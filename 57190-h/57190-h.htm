<div class='c lg'>INTRODUCTION</div>

<p>To you who have travelled in our great
American West this book may serve not
only as a reminder of what you saw, but
also as a lure to draw you back to the glorious
regions which, perhaps, you were obliged
to neglect before. One, two, or three trips
would fall far short of showing you all your
country has to offer, unless you were fortunate
enough to make the period of each
visit cover many months.</p>

<p>The average American citizen has only a
hazy knowledge of what he possesses in his
national playgrounds. The area alone is
stupendous. We have set aside, for our
pleasure and amusement, nearly <span class='sm'>ELEVEN
THOUSAND SQUARE MILES</span> of national parks.</p>

<p>It is your privilege to become a member
of the National Parks Association if you so
wish; through this interesting channel you
can learn in detail the particular charms of
each park.</p>

<p>If these playgrounds are ever connected
by automobile highways, as we hope they
will be some day, there will be in this country
a region for sightseeing tours as the
world has not yet dreamed of.</p>

<p>We have thought serious thoughts, and
done serious things, for some time past;
now the reaction has set in and play we
must and will.</p>

<p>In one park alone, within easy reach,
close to Denver, “The Gateway to the
Rockies,” you may find 51 mountains having
an altitude of more than 10,000 feet,
mountain streams, mountain lakes, big
game, etc., etc., indefinitely. Then go on to
Mount Rainier National Park in Washington,
or Glacier Park in Montana, where
await you sights that fairly stagger even
those who think they are familiar with
mountain scenery, glaciers, etc.</p>

<p>When weary of ascents, or seeking other
sights, where, in what part of the world,
can you find anything to compare with
the Grand Canyon of Arizona? Here
your <i>descent</i> is one mile! No foreign picture
gallery can give you such pictures as
you will get here, for it has not been given
to man to depict such things; Kipling’s
“ten-league canvas with brushes of comets’
hair” would be necessary!</p>

<p>Pass a night on the floor of this canyon,
and choose the time of full moon for it;
you have never had such an experience, nor
could you have elsewhere. If you are
fortunate enough to have unlimited time,
do not leave El Tovar until you have seen
one superb storm, it will stretch your very
soul. This place draws so tremendously
upon the emotions that after it you will
want—what? I can tell you what, the
perfect peace of the Yosemite Valley, for
quiet, intimate beauty, ahead of any spot
on this continent. Here enter a camp
and rest, and roam up and down the valley
floor at your will. Do not leave without
climbing one of the trails, or rather letting
a horse or mule climb it with you on his
back At Glacier Point and you will know
full well why I urge you to make the
trip.</p>

<p>For the student who would know more
of his country, the West is an open book,
waiting only for him to turn the pages.</p>

<p>For the automobilist, Paradise awaits
you! For the aviator, landings are being
prepared; the one which I saw at Crater
Lake in the summer of 1919 will enable
you to reach an extinct volcano of incomparable
beauty. For you who have
never been in our wondrous West, may
this book help you to decide to spend what
has been saved for your next trip there,
where you get 100 per cent. value for your
money!</p>

<p>As my object is to give, in the shortest
space possible, suggestions for the westbound
traveller, the matter is arranged in
five parts.</p>

<!-- :special 2 0 1 -->
<div class='sa1'>DENVER</div>
</div>

<p>Denver, the capital of Colorado,
“The Gateway To The Rockies,”
is situated on the South Platte
River and is only a few miles east of the
Rocky Mountains. The city has developed
tremendously along civic lines of
recent years and there are many public
buildings which are well worth visiting, but
as my rule will be throughout this book to
omit any descriptions of cities, I must begin
here. One can always procure maps of our
cities and information regarding them from
the Civic Centres, so here we will consider
Denver as the best starting place from
which to make countless charming trips.<a id='p4'></a></p>

<p>Boulder is 29 miles northwest of Denver;
this is a fine drive; the trip to Georgetown
and the famous “Loop” is also well worth
while.</p>

<p>If one has time for an all-day trip,
“Corona” is satisfying; situated, as it is,
on the crest of the main range, it is quite a
tremendous climb; this is said to be the
highest point reached by a standard-gauge
railroad in the United States. The station
is decidedly crude and there was sad disorder
to pass through in 1919, but having
overlooked that, the view fully repaid one.</p>

<p>The drive through Bear Creek Canyon,
via Lookout Mountain, is magnificent.</p>

<p>There are countless trips to be made all
round the city of Denver. If one only has
a few hours here the view from the top of
the Equitable Building is perhaps the most
satisfactory, and the beautiful city parks
may be visited.</p>

<p>In a wonderful unbroken line stand the
great mountains, the view extending from
Long’s Peak on the north to Pike’s Peak
on the south. Almost any of these mountains<a id='p5'></a>
may be ascended nowadays, some
parties starting from Denver, others from
Estes Park.</p>

<p>The Denver and Rio Grande Railway
makes a delightful tour called “Around the
Circle,” a four-day trip, stopping overnight
at Durango, Silverton, and Ouray.
On this trip the traveller passes through
four beautiful canyons, over three or four
mountain passes, winding back and forth
over 1,000 miles of the Rocky Mountains.
The ticket is good for 60 days, so that the
stops may be made to suit any one.</p>

<!-- :special 2 0 1 -->
<div class='c sa1 sb2'>ESTES PARK</div>

<p>This beautiful park lies 7,500 feet above
sea level, and can be reached in five hours
from Denver by the Union Pacific Railway
or automobile.</p>

<p>In the park are splendid hotels, where
the traveller is made welcome, and from
which fine tours are made through such
scenery as only our great West can boast,
mountains, valleys, lakes, and rivers; the
views include many peaks of the Rocky<a id='p6'></a>
Mountains—Long’s, 14,270 feet; Ypsilon,
13,500 feet; Hague, 13,832 feet. Mountain
climbing to the heart’s content, hunting,
fishing, and all the quieter sports may also
be enjoyed here.</p>

<p>The trails take us in two hours from
flower-strewn meadows to glaciers.</p>

<!-- :special 2 0 1 -->
<div class='c sa1 sb2'>THE ROCKY MOUNTAIN NATIONAL PARK</div>

<p>Leaving Estes Park, which forms the
eastern gateway to the Rocky Mountain
Park, we enter one of the finest sections of
this magnificent range.</p>

<p>The park embraces a most interesting
part of the Continental Divide. For the
mountain climber this is a veritable Paradise,
for there seem to be peaks of every
size and trails leading in every direction.
For those who like the more easy method,
the automobile roads are excellent. The
drive through Big Thompson Canyon is
one to rejoice the heart of the most blasé.
The area of the park is 398 square miles.
“There are 51 mountains with summits
more than 10,000 feet high, also unnumbered<a id='p7'></a>
canyons, about 200 lakes, waterfalls,
glaciers, native forests, and endless numbers
of beautiful wild flowers.” The richness
of this park is inconceivable. One is
tempted to go into endless detailed descriptions,
but it must not be.</p>

<p>Many weeks may be spent here making
different trips every day. There is every
kind of accommodation, from the simplest
camp to the most comfortable hotel, and
all of this only 70 miles from Denver.</p>

<p>The big game in the park is increasing
all the time, Rocky Mountain sheep, elk,
deer, etc., and there are one hundred
varieties of wild bird life.</p>

<p>“Entry to the park by any route is
dramatic. If the visitor comes the all-motor
way through Ward he picks up the
range at Arapaho Peak, and follows it
closely for miles. If he comes by any of
the rail routes, his motor stage emerges
from the foothills upon a sudden spectacle
of magnificence—the snowy range, its
highest summit crowned with cloud, looming
upon the horizon across the peaceful<a id='p8'></a>
plateau. By any route the appearance of
the range begins a panorama of ever-changing
beauty and inspiration, whose
progress will outlive many a summer’s stay.</p>

<p>“Wherever one lives, however one lives,
in this broad tableland, he is under the
spell of the range. The call of the mountains
is ever present. Riding, walking,
motoring, fishing, golfing, sitting under the
trees with a book, continually he lifts his
eyes to their calm heights. Unconsciously
he throws them the first morning glance.
Instinctively he gazes long upon their
gleaming moon-lit summits before turning
in at night. In time they possess his spirit.
They calm him, exalt him, ennoble him.
Unconsciously he comes to know them in
all their myriad moods. Cold and stern
before sunrise, brilliant and vivid in mid-morning,
soft and restful toward evening,
gorgeously coloured at sunset, angry, at
times terrifying, in storm, their fascination
never weakens, their beauty changes but
does not lessen.”</p>

<p>New roads and wonderful trails are being<a id='p9'></a>
built on all sides here, and there is every
variety of mountain scenery, large and
small canyons with glacial lakes; broad,
rolling plains, and mountain climbing, from
the most simple to the wildest, steepest
that heart could desire. Some of the
smaller trips are those leading to Fern and
Odessa lakes, to Bear Lake at the outlet
of the Tyndall Gorge, to Loch Vale, Sky
Pond, and the Lake of Glass, etc., etc.,
until one may reach Longs Peak’s western
precipice. “These spots are each a day’s
round trip from convenient overnight
hotels, which deserve all the fame which
will be theirs when the people come to
know them, for as yet only a few hundreds
a summer, of Rocky Mountain’s hundred
thousand guests, take the trouble to visit
them.”</p>

<p>Those planning to stay any length of
time in this park will find “The Book of
The National Parks,”<sup><a id='fn1r' href='#fn1'>1</a></sup> from which I should
like to quote a great deal more, their best
guide.</p>

<!-- :special 4 1 2 -->
<div class='c'>
<div class='sm sa1 sb4' id='p1c2'>CHAPTER TWO</div>
<div class='lg sa1'>COLORADO SPRINGS AND PIKE’S PEAK</div>

<!-- :special 2 0 1 -->
<div id='p10' class='sa2'>COLORADO SPRINGS</div>
</div>

<p>Colorado Springs, to the south
of Denver, with its sparkling, life-giving
air, is situated upon an
elevated plateau from whence may be
had a superb view of Pike’s Peak, 14,100
feet.</p>

<p>This peak is probably the best known of
the Rocky Mountains. It lies about six
miles west of Colorado Springs. It is
ascended by a cog-wheel railway, “The
Manitou and Pike’s Peak Railway,” in
about one and one half hours, or by bridle
path in six hours; there is also a most excellent
automobile road, and powerful cars
with good drivers make the round trip in<a id='p11'></a>
six hours. On the summit there is a small
inn, where a light luncheon and a cup of
coffee can be had. The ascent is made during
the summer months only, there being
too much snow in winter. The view is
unusually extensive, and the fascination
of being in such a world of snow is not soon
forgotten.</p>

<!-- :special 2 0 1 -->
<div class='c sa1 sb2'>CHEYENNE MOUNTAIN</div>

<p>The Cheyenne Mountain Road may well
be considered one of Colorado Springs’
most beautiful trips. Passing around the
base of Cheyenne Mountain one glorious
view after another appears. The road
rises pretty steadily and grows decidedly
more narrow, so narrow that only those
with steady heads can really enjoy it.
This drive takes us all the way to Seven
Lakes, a distance of about 22 miles, and
by continuing some five miles farther we
come to Cripple Creek. From Colorado
Springs the trip to the Cheyenne Canyons
may be made. See especially the South
Canyon which can be reached by electric<a id='p12'></a>
car. There is a small admission fee (50
cents), but it is well worth it; there are
beautiful walks here. An easy climb takes
one to the rim.</p>

<!-- :special 2 0 1 -->
<div class='c sa1 sb2'>THE HIGH DRIVE</div>

<p>Seven Falls and the South Cheyenne
Canyon are reached in about an hour’s
drive from Colorado Springs or Manitou,
the return trip being made through Bear
Creek Canyon and over the famous High
Drive. About three hours should be allowed
for the round trip, which is very well
worth while.</p>

<p>On this trip may be seen the last resting
place of Helen Hunt Jackson, who, according
to her own request, lies at the head of
Seven Falls.</p>

<p>Leave your car and stand between Hercules
Pillars, where miles of massive granite
walls tower above you; a more impressive,
picturesque spot is hard to find. I was distressed
here, as I am in many of the beautiful
places of our country, by the thoughtless
scattering of chewing-gum papers,<a id='p13'></a>
candy boxes, etc. Why, when we are
really learning to love the great out-of-doors,
should this awful disorder continue?
Where are the Boy and Girl Scouts? Why
are they not enforcing the law of order,
at least by example?</p>

<!-- :special 2 0 1 -->

<div class='c sa1 sb2'>MANITOU</div>

<p>The great charm of staying in Manitou
is that you are within walking distance of
so many interesting sights, then, too, you
are right among the wonderful Springs.
You can have the waters fresh from the
source as many times a day as you wish.
Manitou is a fascinating little town, situated
in the foothills about Pike’s Peak
and just at the head of the old Ute Pass.
It is six miles from Colorado Springs, and
for those who wish quiet, may be found<a id='p14'></a>
more attractive as a stopping place, than
the more prosperous city.</p>

<!-- :special 2 0 1 -->
<div class='c sa1 sb2'>THE GARDEN OF THE GODS</div>

<p>The Garden of the Gods is only a short
walk from Manitou, and is a most charming
place in which to pass the sunset hour; where
better could one beat this time than beneath
the Cathedral Spires? This is quite the
most impressive spot in this unique garden.</p>

<div class='c sa1 sb2'>THE COLORADO NATIONAL MONUMENT</div>

<p>“This monument, which is near Grand
Junction, Colorado, is similar to the Garden
of the Gods, and is said by some to be more
picturesque.</p>

<p>“It contains fine examples of erosion,
particularly of lofty monoliths; these latter
are found in several tributary canyons,
some of them of very great size, one being
more than 400 feet high.”</p>

<!-- :special 2 0 1 -->
<div class='c sa1 sb2'>MOUNT MANITOU</div>

<p>The trip up Mount Manitou is made by
incline. It would seem hardly worth while<a id='p15'></a>
to ascend so comparatively small a mountain
so near the famous Pike’s Peak; but this
is not so; the view from the top of Manitou
is particularly pleasing, and the tramps on
the top are very lovely. If I had been
obliged to miss either ascent I know now
that I would rather it had been Pike’s Peak.</p>

<div class='c sa1 sb2'>THE CAVE OF THE WINDS</div>

<p>This cave is only a short walk from
Manitou, about two miles, through the
lovely Williams Canyon, and following the
Temple Drive. It is, perhaps, rather too
severe a climb for those who are not used
to this exercise, but the trip is easily made
by automobile. The cave is most unusually
interesting, it is three quarters of a
mile deep, and is composed of sixteen large
rooms and long, winding passages on three
levels. The stalactites and stalagmites
are most fascinating in their formation, and
a brilliant electrical illumination shows off
to perfection all of this truly remarkable
place. The cave alone would repay one for
the trip to Manitou.<a id='p16'></a></p>

<div class='c sa1 sb2'>CLIFF DWELLINGS</div>

<p>I went to see these dwellings the first
time with rather scornful feelings, having
read and always understood that they were
entirely artificial; but I was so impressed by
their natural appearance and solidity that
I made inquiries in Manitou, and was fortunate
enough to meet, and hear at first
hand, the entire story of the bringing of
this dwelling from the Mesa Verde by the
gentleman who moved it, brick by brick
and stone by stone. He assured me that
the greatest care had been used in resetting
every atom exactly as it was found, in a
cliff as nearly like the original as possible.
Hence, this dwelling may be taken as a
good example of the ancient cliff dwellings
by those who are not fortunate enough to
see the original dwellings at the Mesa
Verde.<a id='p17'></a></p>

<div class='sa2'>SALT LAKE CITY</div>
</div>

<p>The capital of the state of Utah is
situated in a large valley surrounded
by mountains, chiefly the Wahsatch
range. This city was founded by the
Mormons in 1847 before the “Territory of
Utah” was organized.</p>

<p>The Tabernacle was built in 1864-67, a
large, unusual, oval-shaped building, 250
feet long, 150 feet wide and 70 feet high; it
is said to seat 12,000 people. It is open to
visitors. The Tabernacle was built in its
present form in 1893, and is reported to
have cost more than $4,000,000; this building
is not open to visitors.</p>

<p>From Prospect Hill an excellent view of<a id='p18'></a>

<div class='c sa1 sb2'>THE GREAT SALT LAKE</div>

<p>Some 5 miles from Salt Lake City is
the Great Salt Lake, 80 miles long and 30
miles wide; it varies greatly in depth.</p>

<p>Beautiful mountainous islands rise out of
the lake and the whole body of water is
picturesque to a degree. The tints of
the water at sunset are exquisite, and the
floating spars, so often seen here, heavily
encrusted with salt crystals, add greatly
to the dazzling effects of the rays of
light.</p>

<p>The trip across the lake by rail is one of
the interesting experiences in going to the

<div class='c sa1 sb2'>OGDEN AND THE OGDEN CANYON</div>

<p>Ogden lies 30 miles north of Salt Lake

know that the Ogden River Canyon is a<a id='p19'></a>

automobile or by street car.</p>

<!-- :special 2 0 1 -->
<div class='c sa1 sb2'>THE CANYON OF THE ARKANSAS</div>

<p>At Canyon City, situated at the mouth
of the canyon of the Arkansas, if you
happen to have taken the “Denver and
Rio Grande Scenic Railway” for this section
of your trip, you leave the Pullman
car and take your seat in a flat, uncovered
observation car (during the summer
months) and so pass through this superb
gorge. The next ten miles takes you
through a bit of scenery worth going anywhere
to see. There is a fine piece of
engineering here. The train seems in spots
to cling to the sides of the gorge, and it is
here that we cross the famous Hanging
Bridge, the waters of the Arkansas dashing
madly past. Strangers who have never
been in this part of the world before may
possibly be misled into thinking they are
seeing the Grand Canyon while passing
through here; but this canyon of the
Arkansas must not be confounded with the<a id='p20'></a>
canyon of the Colorado River, which is
known all over the world as “The Grand
Canyon.” It is a sad pity that the word
GRAND has been used in connection with
these lesser canyons. It is a misnomer,
and I know that many people have been
misled by it.</p>

<div class='c sa1 sb2'>THE MESA VERDE NATIONAL PARK</div>

<p>Of all the ruins of prehistoric peoples in
our great Southwest, these are the largest,
best preserved, and most picturesquely
situated, hence Congress has set aside as a
National Park this large area of 48,966
acres under the above title.</p>

<p>This mesa, or high tableland, is cut by
many canyons, and in these canyon walls
are found most of the cliff dwellings of this
truly remarkable region. Much has been
done here to make it possible for the traveller
to reach and explore, for himself,
these dwellings of the ancients.</p>

<p>The best approach is from Mancos,
Colorado; from here to the ruins is only
10 miles (as the crow flies) and some 30<a id='p21'></a>
miles by auto road on account of the
various canyons to be traversed; a trip
more full of interest would be hard to find
in any country.</p>

<p>The trip from Mancos to Spruce Tree
Camp is made in about three hours, and
here we are taken care of for the night.</p>

<p>The park was established to protect the
wonderful cliff dwellings of the Mancos
Canyons, which are said to be among the
most important remains of this mysterious
race. There is one dwelling here in excellent
preservation, others in varying
stages of demolition. The age of these
ruins is supposed to be from 500 to 1,000
years. To those who are especially interested
in this region and who desire
further information, I recommend Mr.
T. H. Chapin’s “The Land of the Cliff
Dwellers.”</p>

<p>“The principle and most accessible ruins
are the Spruce Tree House, Cliff Palace,
Balcony House, and Tunnel House. Spruce
Tree House is located in the head of Spruce
Tree Canyon, a branch of Navajo Canyon.<a id='p22'></a>
It originally contained about 130 rooms,
built of dressed stone laid in adobe mortar,
with the outside tiers chinked with chips
of rocks and broken pottery.</p>

<p>“Cliff Palace is located about two miles
east of Spruce Tree House, in a left branch
of Cliff Canyon, and consists of a group of
houses with ruins of 164 rooms, including
20 round kivas, or ceremonial rooms, and a
tapering, loopholed tower forming a crescent
of about 100 yards from horn to horn,
which is reputed to be one of the most
famous works of prehistoric man in existence.</p>

<p>“Balcony House, a mile east of Cliff
Palace, in Ruin Canyon, contains about
25 rooms, some of which are in almost
perfect condition.</p>

<p>“Tunnel House, about two miles south
of Spruce Tree House, contains about 20
rooms and two kivas connected by an
elaborate system of underground passages,
and a burial ground of 5,000 square feet.
In each of these villages is an elaborate
system of fortification, with, in some cases,<a id='p23'></a>
walls two to three feet thick and 20 feet
high, watchtowers 30 feet high, and blockhouses
pierced with small loopholes for
arrows....”</p>

<p>I should advise any traveller planning to
visit any of the Southwest Indian Reservations
to go well armed with literature. The
U. S. Government circulars, from which the
above is quoted, may be had from the
Department of the Interior, and the Santa
Fé Railroad provides excellent literature.</p>

<div class='c sa1 sb2'>ZION NATIONAL PARK</div>

<p>“With the creation of the Zion National
Park in 1919 there entered into our National
Park system a reservation as remarkable,
as brilliantly beautiful, and as
highly differentiated from all others as any
of the distinguished group. It contains a
hundred and twenty square miles of
painted terrace country of southern Utah,
surrounding from its source a shallow river
whose carved and fretted and monumented
canyon lies between sandstone walls which
rise two thousand feet in gorgeous mottled<a id='p24'></a>
reds, surmounted by a thousand feet in
marble-white.</p>

<p>“This Park makes two principal appeals,
that to the universal delight in extraordinary
beauty of colour and form, and that
to the intelligence of the student of earth’s
history.... To the best of my knowledge,
there is no place in the world where
one may see so easily so much of the record
of the earth’s history.</p>

<p>“This canyon winding like a snake,
abounding in enormous peaks and domes
and glowing like a Roman sash, is one of
the most striking spectacles which America
has to offer.”<sup><a id='fn2r' href='#fn2'>2</a></sup></p>

<p>The canyon is some 60 miles north of

<div class='sm sa1 sb4' id='p2c1'>CHAPTER ONE</div>
<div class='lg sa2'>THE CANADIAN ROCKIES</div>
</div>

<p>In writing of the Northern Rockies
we must leave our own territory long
enough to say a few words of the
superb section of this great range, which is
known as the “Canadian Rockies,” where
for 500 miles, east and west, the Canadian
Pacific trains pass through incomparable
scenery. One stands amazed at the feats
of engineering which have been carried
through all along these lines. One great
mountain after another looms up before
us, their bald heads seeming to pierce the
very sky, while the snow lies many feet
deep on their sides. The Selkirks defy
description! The train glides through one
wonderful pass after another.</p>

<p>The traveller should arrange to stop
at Banff, the gateway to the Canadian<a id='p30'></a>
Rockies. The railroad has a fine hotel
there from which may be made many
splendid excursions in the vicinity, all are
easily accessible by motor, carriage, horseback,
or on donkeys. The lake, about
nine miles off, known as “Lake Minnewanka,”
sixteen miles long, makes a
delightful excursion; this lake, whose waters
are very deep, is walled in by tremendous
cliffs; steam launches make the round trip.</p>

<p>Continuing westward from here, we
come, in about two hours, to Laggan, the
station for Lake Louise. Leaving the
train and taking an incline car we soon find
ourselves part way up one of these splendid
mountains, where this indescribable gem,
Lake Louise, suddenly bursts upon our
sight. There is hardly a finer spot than
this in Switzerland; the lake, 5,645 feet
above sea level, lies in a hollow at the base
of three great mountains, and at the far
end, in the most dramatic setting, is the
superb Victoria Glacier, facing directly
the Château Lake Louise, where we immediately
try to procure rooms looking<a id='p31'></a>
out upon this lovely view. As soon as you
are settled, start out and walk round the
lake, 3 or 4 miles. This gives you an intimate,
friendly feeling which will almost
undoubtedly be succeeded by a feeling of
awe as the majestic splendour of the place
grows upon you.</p>

<p>From here a most interesting set of
mountain trips may be made by either
road or bridle path; the latter is of course
the better, as one can go farther and climb
higher. I cannot go into detail, but the
hotel gives full information, provides horses,
guides, etc. Do not fail to see Mirror
Lake (altitude 6,550 feet) or Lake Agnes
(altitude 6,820 feet), truly a lake in the
clouds, and encircled by majestic peaks.
The beauty of this region cannot be exaggerated.</p>

<p>The “Valley of the Ten Peaks” is unique,
and this is a trip all can make, a 10-mile
drive over good roads. I shall attempt no
description of this valley, one must see it.
Leaving Lake Louise and Laggan, we pass
through Field, where another stop may be<a id='p32'></a>
made, and various interesting excursions
taken.</p>

<p>Glacier, near the summit of the inexpressibly
beautiful Selkirk Range, ought
not to be passed by; here again comfortable
accommodations have been arranged.
Mount Sir Donald, pointed out as we pass,
rises to a height of more than a mile from
the railroad.</p>

<p>At Sicamous there is also a temptation
to stop and explore, for we are nearing the
end of the five hundred miles of the Rocky
Mountains through which we pass. Beyond
Ashcroft we enter the canyon of the
Thompson, through Agassiz and Mission
Junction, and about 50 miles farther on we
reach Vancouver. I attempt no description
of this interesting city for the reason
given above, adequate information and
local maps can always be had in every
metropolis.</p>

<p>A suggestion for a camping trip, to be
taken from Lake Louise, has just come to
me. I insert it for those who may wish
to plan such a trip.<a id='p33'></a></p>

<div class='c sa1 sb2'>THE TRAIL OF THE STONEY INDIAN</div>

<p>“Lake Louise, Alberta, is the point from
which you start on this little-used and
superb trail, with saddle and pack horses
and the guides who will cook the meals,
wrangle the horses, and steer you safely
over any or all difficulties, bad trails, steep
cliffs, and treacherous glaciers. You take
with you all your provisions, tents, and
whatever you may need for the trip.</p>

<p>“Along the Bow River you wend your
way, vast snow-topped mountains on every
side, and the trail winding now over steep
shale slopes, with the panorama of sparkling
glaciers, rushing rivers, and deep canyons;
again, plunging into a pine forest
where the ground is covered with delicate
pink twin flowers and white anemones;
riding all day and sleeping out under the
blue sky where, if you are fortunate, the
Northern Lights flash in flames of red and
gold. Here one wants to linger indefinitely.</p>

<p>“Passing Pyramid Peak, with its almost
insurmountable overhanging cliffs, Mount<a id='p34'></a>
Murchison, calm and majestic, at last you
reach the Saskatchewan River. The horses
plunge up to their withers in icy water
which rushes by foaming around the knees
of the rider, but the other side is reached
in safety. Sometimes your camping
ground is by an old wigwam of the Stoney
Indians, littered with grotesque, carved
wooden animals and people, made by the
children, with here and there a discarded
moccasin or broken knife; again you may
find an Indian ‘sweat-bath’ made of
saplings bent in a half circle; the Indians
cover this framework with blankets and
pour water over red-hot stones which are
placed at one end, making a regular Turkish
bath. Usually, however, the trail is
unmarred by signs of man; in many places
great trees have fallen across the path
and have to be cut away before you can
ride on.</p>

<p>“Mount Athabaska and Mount Wilcox
loom before you, or perhaps you turn to
the north, into the Brazeau country,
where the mountain sheep roam in great<a id='p35'></a>
flocks. But ever you follow the sparkling
rivers, now passing deep blue-green lakes
nestling among the rocks and now crossing
high, treeless passes, or barren, boulder-strewn
hillsides, and always surrounded by
the mountains with their ever-changing
colours, now gray and sombre, now red,
amber, and purple as they catch the glow
of the sinking sun.</p>

<p>“The solitude and stillness are broken
only by the thunder of a distant avalanche,
or murmur of a near-by stream, the glorious
scenery and the wildness of it all
catching and holding you with a fascination
that cannot be cast off.”<sup><a id='fn21r' href='#fn21'>1</a></sup></p>

<div class='sm sa1 sb4' id='p2c2'>CHAPTER TWO</div>
<div class='lg sa2'>GLACIER NATIONAL PARK AND THE YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK</div>
</div>

<p><a id='p36'></a>The main features of interest to the
average American traveller in this
Northern Rocky Mountain region
are, of course, Glacier National Park and
the Yellowstone National Park.</p>

<p>Glacier Park is situated in the northwest
of Montana. The reservation comprises
915,000 acres and contains 260 lakes
and 60 glaciers, varying from five square
miles to a few acres in area.</p>

<p>Here as in all the other great national
parks of our western country, camps have
been provided, and every kind of accommodation,
from this to elaborate hotels, is to
be had there.<a id='p37'></a></p>

<p>It is quite impossible to attempt a description
of all these parks without a very
long list of new adjectives, for Nature has
been more than generous in dowering this
part of the world with wonderful scenery.
See lakes McDonald, St. Mary, McDuff,
and Iceberg Lake; this last is almost surrounded
by great towering cliffs, many of
them rising to an elevation of 2,000 feet,
in the crevices of which lie large glaciers.
Even in the short space of time which the
average tourist gives this spot, he is frequently
rewarded by hearing and seeing
some great fragment break from its parent
glacier and crash into the water, where,
in the form of small icebergs, they are
always seen floating; hence the name of the
lake.</p>

<p>Blackfeet Glacier is the largest and by
far the most impressive in the park; none
but hardy mountain climbers should attempt
the ascent.</p>

<p>The park is reached by the Great Northern
Railroad, from either Belton or Glacier
Park. “Stop-overs” are allowed on any<a id='p38'></a>
transcontinental ticket, and one, two, or
three day tours will be arranged as requested.</p>

<p>There is a fine hotel at Glacier Park
Station and from here automobile roads
lead in to the “Many-Glacier” Hotel
and the chalet-like groups of camping
places.</p>

<p>But I do not wish to give the impression
that Glacier Park is a place to be visited
en route; far from it; it is a place to go to
for weeks or months, a place for the invalid
to rest in, for the student of Nature to
revel in, or for the most vigorous young
people to tramp in. By far the most
attractive way to see the park is on
foot and is becoming more and more
popular. Walking tours can be arranged
at a very small cost, the party either
taking its own outfit, or using the chalets
scattered through the park for their
benefit.</p>

<p>Full information on this park can
be obtained from the Great Northern
R. R. or the Department of the Interior.<a id='p39'></a></p>

<div class='c sa1 sb2'>THE DEVIL’S TOWER<br/> <span class='sm'>(NATIONAL MONUMENT)</span></div>

<p>“The Devil’s Tower is one of the most
conspicuous features in the Black Hill region
of Wyoming. It rises with extreme
abruptness from the rough Wyoming levels
just back of the Black Hills. It is on the
bank of the Belle Fourche River. This
extraordinary tower emerges from a
rounded forested hill of sedimentary rock
which rises six hundred feet above the
plain; from the top of that the tower rises
six hundred feet still higher. It is visible
for a hundred miles or more in every direction.
The visitor approaching by automobile
sees it hours away, and its growth
upon the horizon as he approaches is the
least of his memorable experience....</p>

<p>“The Devil’s Tower can be likened to
nothing but itself. It is the core of a volcanic
formation which doubtless once had a
considerably larger circumference. At its
base lies an immense talus of broken columns
which the loosening frosts and the<a id='p40'></a>
winter gales are constantly increasing; the
process has been going on for untold thousands
of years, during which the softer
rock of the surrounding plains has been
eroded to its present level.”<sup><a id='fn22r' href='#fn22'>2</a></sup></p>

<!-- :special 2 0 1 -->
<div class='c sa1 sb2'>THE BITTER ROOT VALLEY, MONTANA</div>

<p>The Bitter Root Valley, at the foot of
which Missoula lies, is one of the rich and
beautiful western valleys and is interesting
historically. Lewis and Clark traversed the
valley in 1805-06 and some of their great
hardships were encountered in crossing the
Bitter Root Mountains. The point where
their trail turned into the range is about
12 miles above Missoula.</p>

<p>At Stevensville, about 28 miles up this
valley, Father De Smet established his first
mission to the Salish, or Flathead, Indians,
in 1841. The old church, St. Mary’s, still
stands and is used at intervals. The Indians
were removed from here many years
ago.</p>

<p><a id='p41'></a>The valley has a great reputation for its
fruits and vegetables.</p>

<p>At Ravalli, on the Flathead Reservation,
the Government has established a bison
preserve of about 18,000 acres, with a herd
of from one to two hundred of these fine
creatures. This reservation is reached by
the Northern Pacific Railroad from Arlee,
Montana, and a drive of four or five miles.</p>

<p>From here westward to Pend d’Oreille
we follow the Clark fork of the Columbia
River. Lake Pend d’Oreille, Idaho, is one
of the crystal gems of the west; it is 55
miles long and from 2 to 15 miles wide.
These sparkling waters fill what was a deep
mountain canyon. Soundings have been
made to the depth of 4,000 feet without
finding bottom. Exquisitely wooded mountains
rise from the water’s edge, forming a
wonderful setting.</p>

<p>Lake Coeur d’Alene, the source of the
Spokane River, is another lovely spot in

<p>On the way to the Yellowstone National
Park by way of the Wyoming entrance,
at Cody, and three miles east of
the great Shoshone Dam, a limestone cave
has been set apart under the above title.</p>

<p>The way in is rough and precipitous, and
after entering the cave a descent by rope
is necessary to reach the chambers, which
are of unusual beauty and extend for more
than a mile through galleries, some of
which are heavily encrusted with crystals.</p>

<!-- :special 2 0 1 -->
<div class='c sa1 sb2'>THE YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK</div>

<p>The Yellowstone National Park is situated
in the extreme northwest corner of<a id='p44'></a>
Wyoming, extending a few miles into Montana
on the north and into Idaho and
Montana on the west. The reservation,
set apart by act of Congress in 1872, is
5,500 square miles.</p>

<p>From Salt Lake City or Ogden this park
is reached by the Denver Rio Grande
Railway or the Union Pacific in about 12
hours, but this trip, like so many others,
can be arranged for you by whatever line
you take.</p>

<p>The Northern Pacific Railway offers a
splendidly arranged tour to and through the
park by way of Livingston, the Gate of
the Mountains, and the Upper Yellowstone
River to Gardiner, the original entrance
to the park, and only five miles
from Mammoth Hot Springs, the official
headquarters of the park.</p>

<p>The Yellowstone Park season is from
June 15th to September 15th. It is not
necessary to suggest what shall be seen
here, for the trips are all arranged for one,
and none should leave without making the
complete tour. This park is unlike any<a id='p45'></a>
other; it is unique in many ways. It contains
geysers, mud volcanoes, mineral
springs, and the most gloriously coloured
pools. The Yellowstone Canyon can be
compared with no other; here we have a
riot of colour, said by many to rival the
colours of the Grand Canyon, really so
entirely different as to make comparison
impossible. The walls of the Yellowstone
Canyon are divided by a space of many
miles at the top, which narrows down to
three quarters of a mile at the base, where
the foaming waters dash between them, and
here the fragments of all the lost rainbows
seem to have been collected.</p>

<p>There are many fine mountain peaks,
the finest being Mount Washburn, which
has an elevation of 10,346 feet, named for
General Washburn, the head of the Washburn-Doane
exploration party, who first
climbed it in 1870. From here one gets
the only view of the park as a whole. I
have never forgotten a remark which I
heard John Muir make about this spot;
he said: “When you go to the Yellowstone<a id='p46'></a>
Park do not leave it under any
consideration until you have been taken
up Mount Washburn, and when you reach
the top of the mountain refuse to come
down until you have passed a night on the
summit; never mind about sleep; remember
that there will come a time when you will
take a long enough sleep to make up for all
you can ever lose; this will be a sublime
experience.”</p>

<p>Words cannot tell of the impressiveness
of the geysers. One may sit comfortably
on the veranda of Old Faithful Inn and
watch one eruption after another, repeated
endlessly. But with every change
of light, early morning, noontide, at sunset,
or by moonlight, they are seen with new
interest, and on the moonless nights the
visitors are called to see some of these great
spouts with the rays of a powerful searchlight
upon them.</p>

<p>Old Faithful, which is described as the
most perfect illustration of geyseric phenomena
and whose curious fascination and
real beauty cannot be described, plays<a id='p47'></a>
every 85 minutes to a height of 125 to 150
feet, the eruptions lasting about five minutes.</p>

<p>The Giant Geyser, generally conceded
to be the finest in the park, throws its
great volume of water to a height of
250 feet, playing irregularly about three
times a month and lasting about 90
minutes.</p>

<p>The Castle Geyser, so named for its
beautifully formed crater, plays only once
every 26 or 27 hours, but lasts from 25
minutes to three quarters of an hour.
This is truly an awe-inspiring sight.</p>

<p>The Riverside Geyser is among the favourites.
Standing on the right bank of the
Firehole River, it throws its spray into the
air in a beautiful, graceful arch across the
waters of the river, playing every 7 hours
and lasting about seven minutes, and
almost invariably displaying wonderful
rainbow colours.</p>

<p>There is a plateau a quarter of a mile in
extent, covered with hot pools, each of the
most marvellously brilliant colours—reds,<a id='p48'></a>
greens, yellows, etc.—perhaps the most
beautiful of all being the one known as
Morning-Glory Pool, so named from its
curious shape resembling this well-known
flower.</p>

<p>This park is a famous animal preserve.
Elk deer, buffalo and bear thrive here.
The bears cause great entertainment, coming
down near some of the hotels to feed
upon whatever may be offered them; having
been protected so long, they have no
fear.</p>

<p>Of all of our national parks the Yellowstone
is the largest. It is also the highest
and coolest. We are told that frosts occur
there every month of the year. Mr. Muir
says of it: “The air is electric and full of
ozone; healing, reviving, exhilarating, kept
pure by frost and fire, while the scenery is
wild enough to awaken the dead.</p>

<p>“It is a glorious place to grow in and
rest in. Camping on the shores of the
lakes in the warm openings of the woods,
golden with sunflowers, on the banks of the
streams, by the snowy waterfalls, beside the<a id='p49'></a>
exciting wonders or away from them in the
scallops of the mountain walls sheltered
from every wind, on smooth, silky lawns
enamelled with gentians, up in the fountain
hollows of the ancient glaciers between
the peaks, where cool pools and brooks and
gardens of precious plants charmingly embowered
are never wanting....</p>

<p>“Again and again amid the calmest,
stillest scenery you will be brought to a
standstill, hushed and awe-stricken before
phenomena wholly new to you. Boiling
springs and huge, deep pools of purest green
and azure water, thousands of them are
splashing and heaving in these high, cool
mountains as if a fierce fire were burning
beneath each one of them; and a hundred
geysers, white torrents of boiling water
and steam, like inverted waterfalls, are
ever and anon rushing up out of the hot,
black underworld.</p>

<p>“Some of these ponderous geyser columns
are as large as sequoias—5 to 60 feet
in diameter, 150 to 300 feet high—and are
sustained at this great height with tremendous<a id='p50'></a>
energy for a few minutes, or perhaps
nearly an hour, standing rigid and erect,
hissing, throbbing, booming, as if thunderstorms
were raging beneath their roots....
No frost cools them, snow never
covers them ... winter and summer
they welcome alike ... faithfully rising
and sinking in fairy, rhythmic dance
night and day, in all sorts of weather, at
varying periods of minutes, hours, or weeks....
The largest and one of the most
beautiful of the springs is the Prismatic,
which the guide will be sure to show you.
With a circumference of three hundred
yards, it is more like a lake than a spring.
The water is pure deep, blue in the centre,
fading to green on the edges, and its basin
and the slightly terraced pavement about
it are astonishingly bright and varied in
colour. This one of the Yellowstone fountains
is of itself object enough for a trip
across the continent....</p>

<p>“Near the Prismatic Spring is the great
Excelsior Geyser, which is said to throw a
column of boiling water 60 to 70 feet in<a id='p51'></a>
diameter to a height of from 50 to 300 feet
at irregular periods....”</p>

<p>But I could quote this great nature lover
indefinitely. He is absolutely fascinating
on any of these subjects. See for yourself
“Our National Parks,” by John Muir, and
if you are going west, as he would have you
go, quietly, with time to draw near to nature,
to read and to think, take a copy of
his book with you.</p>

<p>Mr. Muir used his pen as a great artist
uses his brush, his descriptions are the most
exquisite of pictures.</p>

<p>“The Fossil Forests of the Yellowstone
National Park cover an extensive area in
the northern portion of the park, being
especially abundant along the west side of
Lamar River for about 20 miles above its
junction with the Yellowstone. Here the
land rises rather abruptly to a height of
approximately 2,000 feet above the valley
floor. It is known as Specimen Ridge, and
forms an approach to Amethyst Mountain.
There is also a small fossil forest containing
a number of standing trunks near Tower<a id='p52'></a>
Falls, and near the eastern border of the
park along Lamar River in the vicinity of
Cache, Calfee, and Miller creeks, there are
many more or less isolated trunks and
stumps of fossil trees, but so far as known
none of these is equal in interest to the
fossil forest on the slopes of Specimen
Ridge.”</p>

<p>The fossil forests are easily reached over
the wagon roads from the Mammoth Hot
Springs, or from the Wylie Camp at Tower
Falls.</p>

<p>Those who really wish to see these petrified
trees must make a special point of it,
or else they may be told, as I was, that the
two small stumps seen in passing are all
that are there.</p>

<p>In addition to a large redwood stump
which stands 12 feet high, there are two
trunks which stand 25 feet high and are
two feet in diameter; another, three feet in
diameter and 30 feet high, etc.</p>

<p>In addition to these standing trees many
trunks lie prone upon the ground.</p>

<p>Ten species of trees have been found in<a id='p53'></a>
the fossil forests of this park as well as
some 150 fossil plants.</p>

<div class='c sa1 sb2'>JACKSON LAKE</div>

<p>The Jackson Lake region is reached by
automobile, from Old Faithful Inn, at
which place arrangements can be made for
the trip.</p>

<p>The lake lies just north of the very
beautiful Teton Range, across the southern
boundary of the park and about 70 miles
from Old Faithful; this trip makes a most
delightfully worth-while addition to a visit
to the Yellowstone Park; the drive down
is very fine, following the Yellowstone
Lake for a time, crossing the Continental
Divide, with views of the Absoroka Range
to the east, where we see such great peaks
as Mount Langford with an altitude of
10,600 feet; Mount Shurz, 10,600 feet;
Colton Peak, 10,500 feet, and Table Mountain,<a id='p54'></a>
10,800 feet, standing, snow clad, in
the distance.</p>

<p>From Lewis Lake to the border of the
park the drive follows the Snake River, and
shortly after leaving the park the river is
crossed and Jackson Lake comes clearly
into view; the road leads down the east side
of the lake to Moran and here there is a
small hotel where we are taken care of.</p>

<p>There are lovely wild excursions to be
made in every direction. Bold peaks,
unsealed by man, and glacial canyons.
The great ragged peaks of the Teton Range
show every variety of shape and size:
Grand Teton, 13,747 feet, and Moran,
12,100 feet, are the finest, standing as they
do only about five or six miles apart, each
with a lovely lake nestled at its base; what
a superb gateway they may some day make
for a southern entrance to the Yellowstone
Park if, as is now hoped, this region, including
the two mountains and the two
lakes, is to be added to the Yellowstone
Park area.</p>

<p>Mount Moran stands majestically, directly<a id='p55'></a>
across the lake from Moran, where
the lake is about nine miles wide; the view
of this exceptionally beautiful mountain
across the clear, deep-blue water, is one
not easy to forget. To nature lovers,
trampers, and climbers I commend this
region.</p>

<p>Jackson Lake has been connected with
the great system of trails which runs all
through the Yellowstone Park. The traveller
taking this route will follow the east
side of the Yellowstone Lake to the extreme
south end, then the river of the same
name, until, after crossing the river, the
trail follows the Atlantic Creek to the
Divide, over the Divide, and down, following
the Pacific Creek to Moran.</p>

<p>Beautiful views of Mt. Rainier and Mt.
Baker are had as one sails up the sound,
and to the west lie the Olympics.</p>

<p>To speak of the various trips here would

stretch the Olympian Mountains.</p>

<p>Mount Olympus, 8,100 feet in altitude,

<div class='c sa1 sb2'>ALASKA</div>

<p>From Vancouver, British Columbia, to
Skagway, Alaska, is one thousand miles.</p>

<p>This is a most fascinating steamer trip,<a id='p61'></a>
which may also be made from either Seattle
or San Francisco. Winding between
islands and the mainland, passing glaciers
with the summer sun shining overhead, the
steamers stop at various places, and the
interesting Totem Pole People (the Alaskan
Indians), may be interviewed.</p>

<p>Captain Stretch, whose many years of
connection as an engineer with mining and
railroad enterprises in the West and Alaska
render him an authority, says: “Alaska is
a country unique in its geographical situation,
unique in its climate, and unique in
its physical beauties. Cape Barrow, its
northernmost cape, is warmer than any
point in the world as far north of the
equator; and its southern shores bordering
the North Pacific Ocean are likewise
warmer than any point in the world in
similar latitudes during the winter months
as the result of the beneficent influence of
the Japan current. Norway alone can
approach it in these respects, but in Norway
the mountain backbone runs parallel
to the coastline, and its rivers are insignificant<a id='p62'></a>
streams, and there is no room for
extensive valleys; while in Alaska the immense
quadrangle is divided into three
zones by lofty mountains ... which
leave between them broad plains, through
which such streams as the Kuskokwin,
with 600, and the Yukon, with 2,000 miles
of navigable waters, open up its vast interior.
Norway and Sweden are the Mecca
and Medina of the European tourist in
search of the picturesque and sublime, and
the latter country takes its annual toll of
American pilgrims on similar sights intent;
but Alaska can discount anything which
these countries can boast. Its mountains
overtop Mont Blanc, the Jungfrau, or the
Matterhorn; its glaciers dwarf the Mer de
Glace....</p>

<p>“At the Childs Glacier you may loll at
ease by the river bank on a carpet of flowers
while the glacier splits with a noise like a
cannon shot or the staccato reports of
small arms, and watch avalanche after
avalanche start 300 feet above, driving the
water in mighty waves up the general slope<a id='p63'></a>
below you as they take the final plunge and
float away in the narrow river. When the
mist has drifted by, the dead-white face
of the ice disappears. The new dress
glistens with the brilliancy of diamonds,
and the deeper recesses of the façade
gleam blue as a summer sky unflecked by
clouds.</p>

<p>“The charm of the glaciers is never-ending....
The peace and silence
of the rock-bound fiords, clad in green,
with the snowy peaks of far-off mountains
gleaming through the tree tops on the skyline,
suggest the delights of Lotus land;
picture after picture more beautiful than
anything that the Hudson can show, or
either Norway or the Rhine can boast....
There are sunsets such as no
painter could ever put on canvas, veritable
vortices of flame, as though the world was
on fire.... Even the sun is loath
to leave the scene which his warmth has
endowed with life, and forsakes it for only a
few minutes at midnight.</p>

<p>“Along the Alaskan Peninsula the tourist<a id='p64'></a>
may witness in safety the tremendous
pent-up energy of the internal fires; islands
raised from the bottom of the ocean one
year, only to be engulfed the next, as at
Bogoslop....”</p>

<p>Here may be seen: “The crowning
peaks of a mountain range which, dividing
to the east, culminate in Mount McKinley,
20,464<sup><a id='fn31r' href='#fn31'>1</a></sup> feet high, north of Cook Inlet; and
Mounts St. Elias and Fairweather and their
cold virginal sisters, grim guardians of the
northern shores of the Pacific. These
stupendous mountain masses (a mile taller
than Switzerland’s champion), their feet
buried under a glacier which lines the coast
for more than a hundred miles, are even
more impressive than the loftiest of the
world’s famous peaks, either in the Himalayas
or the Andes; for while these rise
from lofty interior plateaus, the sweep of
St. Elias is from ocean to sky, with nothing
to break the foreground.... The<a id='p65'></a>
scenic beauties of Alaska, whether they
be of earth or water or of sky, are varied
enough to bring enthusiasm to the lips of
the most blasé traveller.”<sup><a id='fn32r' href='#fn32'>2</a></sup></p>

<div class='c sa1 sb2'>SITKA NATIONAL MONUMENT</div>

<p>This reservation lies about one mile from

<p>Here was located the village of a warlike

<div class='c sa1 sb2'>MOUNT MCKINLEY NATIONAL PARK</div>

<p>In 1917 Congress set aside as a national
park 2,200 square miles in this region;
as in so many other cases, the reason was to
protect the big game, as well as the magnificent
territory.</p>

<p>“Mount McKinley rises 20,300 feet above
tidewater and 17,000 feet above the eyes<a id='p66'></a>
of the beholder standing on the plateau at
its base. Its enormous bulk is shrouded
in perpetual snow two thirds down from
its summit, and the foothills and broad
plains upon its north and west are populated
with mountain sheep and caribou
in unprecedented numbers.</p>

<p>“In 1915 the Government began the
railroad from Seward to Fairbanks. Its
course lies from Cook Inlet up the Susitna
River to the headwaters of the Nenana
River, where it crosses the range. This
will make access to the region easy and
comfortable.</p>

<p>“Here lies a rugged highland area far
greater in extent than all of Switzerland, a
virgin field for explorers and mountaineers.</p>

<p>“But it must be remembered that this
is not Switzerland, with its hotels, railways,
trained guides, and well-worn paths.
It will appeal only to him who prefers to
strike out for himself, who can break his
own trail through trackless wilds, and will
take the chances of life and limb so dear
to the heart of the true explorer. He who<a id='p67'></a>
would master unattained summits, explore
unknown rivers, or traverse untrodden
glaciers in a region whose scenic beauties
are hardly equalled, has not to seek them
in South America or Central America, for
generations will pass before the possibilities
of the Alaskan Range are exhausted.”<sup><a id='fn33r' href='#fn33'>3</a></sup></p>

<div class='c sa1 sb2'>CRATER LAKE NATIONAL PARK</div>

<p>In 1902 Congress set aside as a national
park this area of 159,360 acres. The lake
lies on the summit of the Cascade Range, in
Oregon, some 65 miles north of the California
border. There are two ways to reach
the park, from Medford or Ashland on the
west, and from Klamath Falls on the
south.</p>

<p>From Medford the trip, 80 miles, is made
by private automobile or by auto-stage;
many interesting features are pointed out
en route. The road leads through the
Rogue River Valley, beside mountain
torrents, and through Oregon’s majestic
forests.</p>

<p><a id='p68'></a>Going in via Klamath Falls, we leave
the main line at Weed, and break the
journey at Klamath, where, as at Medford,
there is a comfortable hotel. From Klamath,
starting in the early morning, either
by private conveyance or auto-stage, the
road runs through the Modoc Valley following
the shore of Klamath Lake; if preferred,
the first part of the trip, from end to end
of the lake, some 40 miles, may be made
by boat. The lake is an interesting body
of water and is the home of great flocks of
pelican. At the north end of the lake the
automobile must be taken for the remainder
of the trip. This region is full of
the historic lore of the Modoc Indians.</p>

<p>Entering the park thus, by the south
gate, and driving up beside the Anna Creek
Canyon, there are very striking features to
be seen; the remarkable walls of the canyon
are unlike anything else, they have the appearance
of lying in folds, and take the
forms of spires and pinnacles of every
variety.</p>

<p>If you are in a hired automobile, insist<a id='p69'></a>
upon being driven slowly; if time is no object,
you will probably walk while this canyon
is in view.</p>

<p>Well within the park we become conscious
of the rise in elevation, and about
three miles before reaching the rim of the
crater the real pull begins. The rim elevation
is 6,239 feet.</p>

<p>Crater Lake is the only lake of its variety
in the United States. As the name implies,
the lake lies in the crater of an extinct
volcano. It has been called: “The Sea
of Silence.”</p>

<p>It is well that I am limited to a short
space on each place mentioned in this
book, for it is a great temptation to write
pages of enthusiastic accounts of Crater
Lake. I can conceive of nothing more
interesting or more beautiful in nature.
The colour is indescribable. The water
lies 1,000 feet below the rim of the crater,
and is 2,000 feet deep.</p>

<p>An excellent trail leads down to the
water’s edge and the descent may be made
either on horseback or on foot; the walk is<a id='p70'></a>
absolutely easy. There are launches and
rowboats on the lake, which tempt one to
explore this most unusual and exquisite
body of water from end to end, or side to
side; the lake is about five miles in diameter.
Places to be visited are Wizard
Island, the Phantom Ship, and the various
caves in the walls of the crater, walls
which lift their towering heads from 1,456
feet to 8,156 feet into the clear, glistening,
deep-blue sky.</p>

<p>Guests are accommodated in the park
in tents, or at the hotel, which though not
completed is in use. The hotel stands on
the rim and the front windows command
a superb view.</p>

<p>The trip around the rim is not to be
compared with anything else that I know;
it is a unique experience; it is as impossible
to write of it as it is to speak of it; one could
give no adequate idea of it. Go and see
it for yourself.</p>

<p>The distant views on all sides are superb,
as are the wooded valleys of the park.</p>

<p>Plenty of time should be allowed here;<a id='p71'></a>
for the real nature lover, there is mountain
climbing to the heart’s content, and for
those who are less strong, the never-ending
changes of light and shadow, with all the
glory which colour can give.<a id='p72'></a></p>

<div class='sa2'>SEATTLE</div>
</div>

<p>Seattle is one of the largest and
most energetic cities of the Northwest,
most beautifully situated on
Puget Sound, girded by the Cascade and
Olympic Mountains.</p>

<p>The city is built on seven hills and is the
proud possessor of one of the finest of harbours,
a triple harbour one might almost
say, for the great salt harbour proper is
connected by canal to Lake Union and
again to the great Lake Washington, some
twenty miles long, thus giving an inland
fresh-water harbour of great value.</p>

<p>Seattle’s tallest building, to the tower
of which one gladly mounts for the superb
views, is only surpassed by the tall buildings
of New York City. Seattle maintains<a id='p73'></a>
thirty-four picturesque parks and connects
them by splendid highways. Scenically, as
in many other ways, this city ranks very
high.</p>

<!-- :special 2 0 1 -->
<div class='c sa1 sb2'>TACOMA</div>

<p>Tacoma is an industrial seaport, beautifully
situated on Puget Sound, of which it
commands a fine view. Here one sees the
Cascade Mountains, and has one of the
finest views possible of that truly noble
mountain, Rainier, that is, if the traveller
has chosen the right time of the year. I
have sat and waited day after day in mid-summer
just to get a glimpse of any mountain,
and failed, but a return trip in the
spring fully repaid me.</p>

<p>Point Defiance Park should be visited,
and the Ferry Museum, which contains an
interesting collection of Indian baskets,
domestic utensils, canoes, and implements
of hunting and war.</p>

<!-- :special 2 0 1 -->
<div class='c sa1 sb2'>MOUNT RAINIER NATIONAL PARK</div>

<p>This park is situated in western Washington,
about 55 miles from Seattle and 42<a id='p74'></a>
miles from Tacoma. When the atmosphere
is clear the mountain can be seen
more than a hundred miles away; it has an
altitude of 14,408 feet and one of the largest
glacial systems in the world radiating from
any single peak.</p>

<p>An excellent automobile highway has
been built from Seattle and Tacoma to the
park, and trips are made daily, in good
cars. The southern part of the park is
reached by rail to Ashford, on the Tacoma
Eastern R. R. (Chicago, Milwaukee and
St. Paul Railroad), thence via automobile
stage to Longmire Springs, in the park.
The northern part of the park is reached
by rail to Fairfax, on the Northern Pacific
Railroad, and by trails from there in; or
from Enumclaw R. R. Station and from
there by automobile.</p>

<p>By far the finest entrance is the southern
or Nisqually River entrance via Longmire
Springs and the great Nisqually Glacier.
The fine Government road running through
the park winds back and forth, beside
the lovely Nisqually River, through fine<a id='p75'></a>
forests, up the heavily wooded mountainside,
past stretches of brilliant wild flowers,
stopping for one superb view after another,
until the great Nisqually Glacier is seen
close by; here we reach the end of the old
motor road; from here the trip had to be
made by stage or on horseback a few years
ago, the highway ending where the eternal
snows began, but to-day the splendid motor
road goes all the way to Paradise Valley.
The traveller who has been fortunate
enough to take this trip will never forget
it. The climb is a steep one, 1,557 feet
from Nisqually Glacier to Paradise Valley;
the road is a one-way road only, all cars
leaving must pass out before the entering
cars are admitted.</p>

<p>The Narada Falls are visited on the way
up the mountain, then comes Inspiration
Point, where a wonderful view of the Tatoosh
Range is had; the road zigzags back
and forth, each view of the noble Rainier
more lovely than the last, until we arrive
at Paradise Valley and Paradise Inn, where
we are well cared for, be our stay a day, a<a id='p76'></a>
week, or a month. From here the mountain
towers above us, 8,700 feet, looking
as enormous as it did from below.</p>

<p>The season of tourist travel is confined
largely to June, July, August, September,
and the first part of October, although
parties of tourists enter the park for snowshoeing
and winter sports. The ideal time
is early in August, when the wild flowers
are at their best; I have seen the valley
at this time, with a quivering cover of red,
white, and blue; the exquisite deer-tooth lily,
the blue lupin, and the flaming red of the
Indian paint brush. I am told that there
are 300 varieties of wild flowers in this park.</p>

<p>The summit of the mountain is accessible
from Paradise Valley, and from St. Elmo
Pass, on the northern side. The difficulty
of the ascent depends largely upon the
condition of the snow fields, which varies
from year to year. <i>It is dangerous and
should not be attempted unless the party is
accompanied by an official guide.</i></p>

<p>Campers are made welcome and are provided
with all sorts of conveniences, from<a id='p77'></a>
the simplest canvas tent to the fine electrically
lighted and heated tents. Those
who wish the full camping experience may
buy groceries at the pavilion and do their
own cooking over open fires. While at the
same time those who wish the regular hotel
comforts can have them at the inn.
Guides, horses, and outfits are furnished by
the Rainier National Park Company to
those desiring to take long or short trail
outings. In recent years the trails have
been extended and new trails are opened
each season; we are told that they now
extend over 150 miles.</p>

<!-- :special 2 0 1 -->
<div class='c sa1 sb2'>SUGGESTIONS FOR MOUNTAIN CLIMBING</div>

<p>The western part of the United States is
so full of wonderful mountain peaks that
the desire to climb one or more is sure to
be one of the results of a western trip.</p>

<p>There are many important rules to be
observed before undertaking one of these
ascents. Firstly, those who intend visiting
any of the national parks should be careful
to go well supplied with warm clothing,<a id='p78'></a>
including warm sleeping apparel. Proper
boots are essential; they should be made of
good heavy material and have thick, strong
soles. Skirts cannot be worn in real mountain
climbing, either bloomers or knicker-bockers
are necessary. The latter garment
one sees so many of the women campers
wearing that they are not at all conspicuous.
It is a great convenience to have
with you a shoulder strap with which to
fasten on the extra jacket or sweater necessary
for use on the crest; arrange to have
nothing in the hands but the stout walking
stick which is indispensable.</p>

<p>Under no consideration should any party
start out to climb any of the great mountains
without the aid of a registered guide.
The trails may easily be lost, especially
so as they lead frequently over snow fields
where the footprints melting from day to
day make a full and accurate knowledge
absolutely essential. Again, there are important
rules as to hours of starting and
arriving, in order to avoid being overtaken
by dark, or in case of being overtaken by<a id='p79'></a>
one of the many sudden, blinding snowstorms;
also a knowledge of how fast or
how slowly one should climb, what food
and drink should be taken, etc., etc., is
necessary. Real mountain climbing is not
in any way like an ordinary tramp, in fact,
as we are told of something else: It is not
by any to be entered into unadvisedly or
lightly, but reverently, discreetly, advisedly,
and soberly.</p>

<p>Where it is a possible thing, those who
contemplate climbing a real mountain
should spend several days in the higher
altitudes of the mountain regions, climbing
about the foothills and becoming accustomed
to the rarefied atmosphere. Strong
stimulants, tea and coffee, should not be
taken, and no heavy, fried food eaten while
preparing to climb.</p>

<p>To those who wish further information
on this subject, again I suggest that they
write to the Department of the Interior,
or to the National Parks Association,
either of which places will send full detailed
information.<a id='p80'></a></p>

<div class='lg sa1'>LAKE CHELAN AND THE COLUMBIA RIVER REGION</div>

<!-- :special 2 0 1 -->
<div class='sa2'>LAKE CHELAN</div>
</div>

<p>In the Cascade Range, in north-central
Washington, lies a remarkably
beautiful and, at present, little-known
lake. This exquisite body of water, some
50 miles long and about one and a half
miles wide, nestles in an ancient glacial
cirque basin 1,075 feet above sea level, with
peaks one mile high surrounding it. Little
has been said of this region heretofore because
of its inaccessibility, but to-day it is
easily reached by the Great Northern R. R.</p>

<p>From Wenatchee a train trip of a little
more than one hour beside the lovely
Columbia River takes you to Chelan
Station, and from there an auto-stage takes<a id='p81'></a>
you the last four miles to the foot of the
lake.</p>

<p>Hotels have been built at both the upper
and lower end of the lake, where you will
be taken good care of. But the thing to
do here is to take one of the camping trips
and see the magnificence of the surrounding
country; the Field Hotel at the head of the
lake arranges these trips, providing all the
necessities for a very reasonable price.</p>

<p>Boats of all varieties are to be had on
the lake; only those who cannot spare the
time to see the lake in the more leisurely
way should use the motor launches, for this
beautiful, green, river-like lake should not
be hurried over; if you are on it for sunset
you will not be satisfied until you have had
a glorious sunrise the same way.</p>

<p>I am told that the fishing, in the many
streams which empty into the lake, is
unusually fine.</p>

<p>Those who consider going to Lake Chelan
should write to the Great Northern
R. R. for their excellent literature on the
subject, also read Walter Prichard Eaton’s<a id='p82'></a>
“Green Trails and Upland Pastures,” from
which I should like to quote several pages
if space were unlimited.</p>

<div class='c sa1 sb2'>THE GRAND COULEE<sup><a id='fn34r' href='#fn34'>4</a></sup></div>

<p>“In the heart of the vast lava plains
which occupy a large part of the States of
Washington, Idaho, and Oregon, lies the
Grand Coulee, a natural feature of grandeur
and wild beauty which is well worthy
of a place among the wonder sights of
America, but which is practically unknown
and unvisited at present....</p>

<p>“The Grand Coulee is a dry gorge or
canyon, cut by the Columbia River, when
it was diverted from its course ages ago
in the glacial period....</p>

<p>“It extends nearly 100 miles across a
part of the so-called ‘Big Bend’ region of
the Columbia River....</p>

<p>“This enormous dry canyon, with its
numerous beautiful lakes and its site of a
great prehistoric waterfall, which was as<a id='p83'></a>
high as the Victoria Falls of the Zambesi
River in Africa and of much greater extent,
may be visited by tourists travelling over
the Northern Pacific Railway, by leaving
the main line at Spokane and travelling
over the branch line 125 miles to Coulee
City, a small town situated on the level
floor of the Upper Coulee, just at the point
to get most of the interesting views of this
curious region.”</p>

<p>Here guests can get comfortable accommodations,
and from here make the various
trips by automobile, carriage, horseback,
or on foot. One should see, first, the site
of the ancient cataract, with its 400- to 440-foot
wall, which separates the Upper from
the Lower Coulee. About four miles further
on one comes to the brink of the
western margin, and following a short distance
a wonderful panorama is disclosed,
hummocks and hollows, lakes and pools,
some of clear and some of strongly saline
water.</p>

<p>The basalt rock of the cliffs turns a rusty
brown under the effects of the weather,<a id='p84'></a>
and is frequently covered with orange or
greenish-yellow lichens in great patches, so
that the cliffs are a glorious riot of colour.</p>

<p>The eastern branch of the Lower Coulee
is in many respects the most interesting
and beautiful, because it is comparatively
narrow, and a large part of it is occupied
by a long lake bordered by vertical cliffs;
this is called Deep Lake. A charming walk
of about two miles takes one to this part.</p>

<p>A visit to this region is a unique experience.</p>

<!-- :special 2 0 1 -->
<div class='c sa1 sb2'>THE COLUMBIA RIVER</div>

<p>The Columbia River is the great river
of the Far West, it is especially interesting
historically; the mere name, to those of us
in the East, recalls the old cry of “54°-40´
or fight,” the slogan of the Democratic
Convention of 1844, which elected James
K. Polk President of the United States,
when this motto was inscribed upon its
banner. The story of the “Oregon Claims”
makes interesting reading indeed, and history
has shown us how the matter was<a id='p85'></a>
settled without “fight.” This beautiful
river means much to the Northwest to-day.</p>

<p>Taking the famous Columbia River
Highway from Portland and going westward,
the traveller finds himself shortly
in Astoria, at the mouth of the Columbia
River, and so on to the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>There are many trips to the beach from
Portland; at Astoria the great water craft
attract attention; here the river is five miles
wide and there are fine fisheries. Across
the river from Astoria and extending from
Columbia to Willapa Harbour is a peninsula
known as North Beach. This is a popular
summer resort, with a superb beach, an unbroken
stretch of sand 26 miles long and from
200 to 400 feet wide, according to the tides.</p>

<p>Any amount of exploring may be done
on the coast of Oregon, which is wild,
rugged, and wooded in places almost to the
water’s edge.</p>

<p>Various trips on, or beside, the Willamette
River, which flows into the Columbia
12 miles below Portland, can be made from
this city.<a id='p86'></a></p>

<!-- :special 2 0 1 -->
<div class='c sa1 sb2'>THE COLUMBIA RIVER TRIP</div>

<p>The Columbia River trip is made by
steamer daily, leaving Portland in the early
morning. (Hours for departing and returning
on such trips are not given, as they
change from time to time, and are easily
obtained in the office of any of the hotels.)</p>

<p>The steamers go all the way up to the
Dalles, through most unusual scenery.
The snow-crowned tops of the great mountains
of the Cascade Range, with their
glaciers and dashing mountain streams,
greet the eye from time to time, while here
and there magnificent cataracts lend excitement;
add to this the unending mystery
of the deep, dark canyons and gorges,
and what more can one ask for a river
trip?</p>

<p>The Pillars of Hercules are twin monuments
of great height, one rising almost
from the water’s edge and the other
separated by a distance of but a few feet.
Castle Rock, which, we are told, was a
lookout station for the Indians, rises 1,146<a id='p87'></a>
feet above the river. This rock was not
scaled by white men until 1901.</p>

<p>The waters of the Multnomah Falls
have a sheer drop of 700 feet into a great
rock basin. These are the finest falls on
the Columbia River. The spray-filled air
gives out beautiful rainbow colours.</p>

<p>Oneonta Gorge, a little farther up the
river, is like a great garden in the spring
of the year; it leads back into the hills for
about a mile, and is carpeted with exquisite
wild flowers and ferns.</p>

<p>We are told that at the Cascades, 45
miles east of Portland, a natural bridge
once spanned the river, the ruins of which
now lie in the river bed, obstructing the
flow and impeding navigation. The story
as told by Balch in his “Bridge of the
Gods” is as follows: “The red men tell
how Mount Hood and Mount Adams,
situated on opposite sides of the river, engaged
in controversy, leading to a quarrel,
and they resolved to engage in combat.
Advancing to a common centre, they met
on the bridge. Their combined weight<a id='p88'></a>
was too much for the structure and it
crumbled beneath its load. The conflict
was thus avoided, and the peaks returned
to their respective places.”</p>

<p>A canal has been constructed through
these rapids, permitting steamers to pass.</p>

<!-- :special 2 0 1 -->
<div class='c sa1 sb2'>THE COLUMBIA RIVER HIGHWAY</div>

<p>Probably few visitors to Portland fail
to take this justly famous drive; certainly
none should fail to take it. Here has been
built a magnificent boulevard reaching
from Portland to the Pacific on the west
and extending to Central Oregon on the
east, following the bank of the lovely
Columbia River. “The Road of Falling
Waters” it has been called, on account of
the many magnificent waterfalls passed
en route; of these “The Multnomah Falls”
are the most famous. In scenic grandeur
it recalls the Alps, the Rhine, and southern
Italy, with all the wild bigness of the
Rockies. It is a wonderful bit of engineering,
in some places the road being cut
through the living rock; again fine concrete<a id='p89'></a>
bridges span gorges and narrow valleys;
to the south may be seen that most picturesque
of mountains, Mount Hood, and
to the north, kingly Mount Rainier, Mount
Adams, and Mount St. Helens. Driving
eastward one passes over 60 miles of
towering cliffs and sparkling waterfalls.</p>

<p>The highway at Crown Point is 700
feet above the river and gives the traveller
a superb view; from here on it drops gradually
until Bonneville is reached, where
those who wish may visit the great fish
hatchery; then on through the tunnel at
Mitchell’s Point to the sunken forests of the
Colorado, where I am told that giant trees
are seen beneath the waters, finally reaching
the beautiful Hood River Valley.</p>

<!-- :special 2 0 1 -->
<div class='c sa1 sb2'>PORTLAND</div>

<p>Portland is a city of peculiar charm;
built upon rolling ground, between the
Cascade Mountains and the ocean, with its
two exceptionally beautiful rivers, it is
provided with unusually fine scenery.
The Rose Festival, held each year in June,<a id='p90'></a>
has attracted great attention, Portland is
called “The Rose City,” and it justifies its
name, for verily, to see the city at this time
is like finding a metropolis hidden in a
fairy garden.</p>

<p>Back of the city, or rather to the west,
rises Council Crest, which commands a
splendid view of the city, the rivers, and
(when it is not foggy) the surrounding
country. Travellers who cannot arrange
to stay in Portland may get a lasting impression
of its charm by stopping over a
few hours and motoring, or going by trolley,
to this spot.</p>

<p>Council Crest is merely a pleasure park,
but there is an observatory there from
which may be had an excellent view of the
fine snow-clad mountains of the Cascade
Range. I have seen from here on a clear
day, Mount Rainier, Mount St. Helens,
Mount Adams, Mount Jefferson, and Mount
Hood. These white monarchs stand far
enough apart to be utterly unspoiled;
each is entirely different in outline from
the others, and the lights and shadows<a id='p91'></a>
and cloud effects from here cannot be
excelled.</p>

<p>Mount Hood, 11,225 feet, is reached by
automobile from Portland. It is a 55 mile
drive through the most lovely forested
country, such cedar trees as one does not
often see, wonderful firs draped in long
moss, stumps of old trees long since dead,
with a heavy growth of young green shoots
sprouting from them such as one sees in
California. The last time I was in Portland
I had waited a week for a clear day
to make this trip; as the clear day did not
come, I made it in a drizzling mist, hoping
all day that the clouds would lift just long
enough to let us see the mountain, even if
only the top; it did not clear all day, but
still that drive stands out in my memory
as one of the loveliest I ever took; the mist
in the forest, a dewdrop on every cedar
tip and fern frond, the waving to and fro
of the glistening boughs, and the stillness
and mystery of everything, made it an
unforgettable occasion. There is a Government
camp on the south slope and the return<a id='p92'></a>
trip can be made in a day. For those
with time to stay, “Cloud Cap Inn,” on
the north side, may be better. There are
a number of trips from the inn to points of
interest, but the climb to the summit is
the most popular. This is said to be the
easiest peak in the west to climb. Guides
are necessary here, as for the other mountains.</p>

<div class='c sa1 sb2'>OREGON CAVES<br/> <span class='sm'>(NATIONAL MONUMENT)</span></div>

<p>In the far southwestern corner of Oregon,

<p>There are two entrances to the caves, one
above and one below. The stalagmites and
stalactites are unusually fine. The vaults

<div class='lg sa1'>NORTHERN CALIFORNIA</div>

<!-- :special 2 0 1 -->
<div class='sa2'>MOUNT SHASTA</div>
</div>

<p>Without doubt, the point of
greatest interest in the extreme
north of California is Mount Shasta,
which rises just at the juncture of the
Sierra Nevada and the Cascade Ranges,
near the head of the Sacramento Valley.</p>

<p>Mount Shasta is a huge extinct volcano,
14,380 feet high; it is most accessible from
Sissons, from whence the trip may be made
by automobile (12 miles) to the summit.
Taking Sissons for headquarters, there are
innumerable trips to be made, on foot,
horseback, or by motor. Soda Springs,
Castle Lake, the McCloud River, etc. Mr.
Muir says of the trip to the summit:
“During the bright days of midsummer the<a id='p96'></a>
ascent of Shasta is only a long, safe saunter
without fright or nerve strain, or even
serious fatigue, to those in sound health.
Setting out from Sissons on horseback,
accompanied by a guide leading a pack
animal with provisions, blankets, and other
necessaries, you follow a trail that leads
up to the edge of the timber line, where
you camp for the night, eight or ten miles
from the hotel, at an elevation of about
10,000 feet. The next day, rising early,
you may push on to the summit and return
to Sissons.... The view from the
top in clear weather extends to an immense
distance in every direction....”</p>

<p>The same writer highly recommends the
trip round the base of Shasta, about one
hundred miles; after reading his “Steep
Trails” one feels very sure that no one
could know more about this Shasta country
than Mr. Muir for he seems to have
walked over every inch of it.</p>

<p>The railroad track runs close to the
Soda Springs, in fact so near that one must
leave the car to see the Springs. Travelling<a id='p97'></a>
either north or south from here the
views of the mountain are exceptionally
beautiful, for Shasta is one of the picturesque,
single-peak mountains; rising in
solitary grandeur from a low, lava plain,
it is thought by many to be California’s
most beautiful mountain; snow-clad and
supreme it stands here; it has been called
the Pole-star of the landscape.</p>

<p>To the south of Shasta County lies a
beautiful and little-known region—the
Feather River Canyon, which has been
opened up by the Western Pacific R. R.</p>

<p>We are told that the rivers and streams
fairly teem with bass and trout; I give the
suggestion for what it may be worth, as I
know no one who has fished these waters.</p>

<p>The northern section of California has
one great attraction: it is far less crowded
than the southern sections; here real exploring
may still be indulged in.</p>

<div class='c sa1 sb2'>LASSEN VOLCANIC NATIONAL PARK</div>

<p>In the year 1914 Mount Lassen, after
200 years of quiet, burst forth with a<a id='p98'></a>
series of eruptions covering a period of
19 months.</p>

<p>Mount Lassen has an altitude of 10,437
feet; unlike the more familiar examples of
volcanic mountains, Vesuvius and Fujiyama,
Lassen has not one large peak, but
four distinct summits, any of which may be
ascended. The view from the top is one
of wonder. Seventy miles away gleams
Mount Shasta; across a line of cones and
craters 150 miles long sparkles the diamond
crown of Mount Pitt. Westward and
southward a vast ocean of ridges falls
lower and lower into the Sacramento
Valley.</p>

<p>“In 1906, in order to conserve the best
examples of recent volcanism, Lassen Peak
and Cinder Cone, in the same region, were
set aside as national monuments, but in
1916, after the great eruptions of Mount
Lassen, a reservation of 124 square miles
in this region, including both peaks, was
made a national park.</p>

<p>“It is believed by scientists that the
volcano will now remain quiet; this will<a id='p99'></a>
in all likelihood become a point of great
interest to the American traveller, being
the only volcano which has been in eruption
in the national boundaries. Many
tourists have already visited it. The park,
though undeveloped as yet, has other
charms, such as forests, lakes, and fine
streams, but the volcano will remain the
chief interest for some time to come.”<sup><a id='fn41r' href='#fn41'>1</a></sup></p>

<div class='c sa1 sb2'>THE DEVIL’S HALF ACRE</div>

<p>Hot Springs Valley and the geyser country
extend some 50 miles east of Mount
Lassen, as far as Mountain Meadows, and<a id='p100'></a>
in this stretch there are more than 200
geysers. This region is well named “The
Devil’s Kitchen,” or, as above, “The Devil’s
Half Acre.” “Boiling Lake, two miles from
the geysers, is a pool of hot water 600 feet
long and 300 feet wide, lying between two
streams of lava and with banks 100 feet
high,” from which there seems to be but
one small outlet.</p>

<div class='c sa1 sb2'>LAKE TAHOE</div>

<p>Going west by the Southern Pacific Railway
we go so near the beautiful Lake
Tahoe that those who can will do well to
stop at Truckee, and taking the train of the
Lake Tahoe Railway and Transportation
Company, follow this lovely mountain
stream, the Truckee, up to the lake (15
miles). You will be made most welcome
and have every comfort at the Tahoe Tavern.</p>

<p>This place is mentioned on page 105
where its accessibility by automobile from
Sacramento is given, the state road thus
reaching the lake at its southern end and
taking the visitors to Al-Tahoe, another
fine hotel from which the various trips
may equally well be made. Small cottages,
with private baths, also open-air
sleeping cabins, can be rented by the day,
week, or month.</p>

<p>Fine automobile roads lead in the various
directions and there are numerous trips
to be made. Tamarack Lake makes a nice<a id='p101'></a>
day’s jaunt, taking a picnic luncheon.
Cascade Lake and Eagle Falls can be
reached either by water or by automobile.
Fallen Leaf Lake makes another lovely
drive. Horseback trips are plentiful, and
the boating is most lovely.</p>

<p>For the fisherman, I am told that one
June day here will bring him back year
after year.</p>

<p>Lake Tahoe lies 6,225 feet above sea
level, it is 23 miles long and 13 miles wide.
Its beauty cannot well be exaggerated.
It is as lovely as Italy’s Lake Como, and
while the mountains rise round Como to a
height of 7,000 feet, these great peaks of
the Sierra Nevadas have an elevation of
11,120 feet.</p>

<p>It is quite impossible to do justice to the
Tahoe region in short space. There are
scores of lakes, linked like a chain, and
lying all round Tahoe.</p>

<p>To the aviator this section must look
like a glorious breastplate: Tahoe the great
central stone with the myriads of smaller
lakes round it and the hundreds of glistening,<a id='p102'></a>
winding rivers making the platinum
setting, the whole lying lightly upon the
breast of mother earth.</p>

<p>There are numbers of hotels, boarding-houses,
and camps in this lake region, but
do not let this make you think that it is
spoiled by crowding, there are not yet as
many houses as there are lakes.</p>

<p>Sacramento, the capital of California,
is situated on the east bank of the Sacramento
River. The city is finely laid out,
with wide, handsome streets. The most
important building, which attracts the eye
before the traveller reaches the city, is the
State Capitol, with a beautiful dome, which
recalls that of the National Capitol. The
surrounding country is interesting. From
Sacramento down to the mouth of the river
the banks are like one great garden. Here
we get our first view of the beautifully kept
olive groves, the soft gray-green of the
foliage reminding one of Italy.</p>

<p>From here many charming trips can be
made, Sacramento being one of the railway
centres for the interior of California. Electric<a id='p103'></a>
lines also run from here in almost every
direction. The trip from this city to San
Francisco by boat is well worth while.
There is a line of steamers which makes the
round trip from San Francisco several times
a week.</p>

<div class='c sa1 sb2'>LODI AND THE CALAVERAS BIG TREES</div>

<p>About 30 miles south of Sacramento lies
Lodi, one of the largest grape-growing
centres of the state, and from here, by the
Valley Spring branch of the Southern
Pacific Railroad, may be reached the
Calaveras Big Trees and the mining district
made familiar to many through Mark
Twain’s “Jumping Frog of Calaveras” and
Bret Harte’s “Bellringer of Angels.” These
writers both lived in the small town of
Angels, Calaveras County.</p>

<p>The Calaveras Grove of Big Trees is the
farthest north of any of the Big Tree
groves, and was the first of these forests
discovered. Here may be seen some of the
finest specimens of this woodland monarch.
There are about 100 trees ranging from 300<a id='p104'></a>
to 375 feet in height and from 70 to 90
feet in circumference. From here one
may drive to the most important of all the
groves in point of number, South, or Stanislaus,
Grove, where the trees are not nearly
as large, but where there are said to be
more than 1,000 of them. In both of
these groves, as in the well-known Mariposa
Groves, one sees traces of the great
damage done by fire. The trees are now
carefully guarded, and it is to be hoped
that fires from carelessness may never
happen again. The average American
citizen is becoming more and more awakened
to the value of the great nature wonders
and their preservation each year, and
yet how recent is the tragedy of the Hetch
Hetchy Valley.</p>

<p>At Murphys, in the Calaveras district,
there is quite a remarkable cave, discovered
by the miners in 1850, where there are
some curious formations and stalactites.</p>

<p>A wonderful trip by motor from Sacramento
is made via the State Road, or what
is locally known as “The Wishbone Route.”<a id='p105'></a>
The drive covers 275 miles, going from
Sacramento to Donner Lake and Truckee,
then 15 miles along the beautiful Truckee
River to Al-Tahoe, that most enticing place
mentioned on page 100. On the return
trip the drive follows the lake shore for
about 25 miles, coming back to the State
Road and through Placerville to Sacramento.<a id='p106'></a></p>

<!-- :special 2 0 1 -->
<div class='sa2'>THE YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK</div>
</div>

<p>The usual entrances to the Yosemite
Valley are via Fresno and Merced.
The best time to visit this park is
perhaps April or May, while the falls are
still full. From Merced to El Portal (the
gate), the Yosemite Valley Railway runs
some 70 miles along the banks of the Merced
River, for which trip the right-hand side
of the train is best (right as one stands
facing the engine); the view is better from
this side. The train crosses and recrosses
this gaily-romping river, and the valley
view changes continually, the walls becoming
quite high in places and the river foaming
rapids.</p>

<p>Reaching El Portal in the late afternoon,<a id='p107'></a>
one climbs up the winding footpath through
a picturesque tangle of brush to the Hotel
Del Portal, where all the necessary comforts
are provided. After passing the
night in this delightful spot, one is taken
early the next morning into the valley
proper, by a road which follows the winding
course of the Merced River, and from
which giant granite walls reach up toward
the sky on either side.</p>

<p>Arriving at El Capitan, the great rock
7,630 feet high which stands, as it were,
at the inner gate of this Paradise, we learn
that this granite mountain exhibits to view
400 acres of bare rock! Yet this is only
one of many. The Yosemite Valley is
7 miles long and three quarters of a mile
wide. It lies 4,060 feet above sea level and
is enclosed by walls rising from 3,000 to
4,000 feet above the floor of the valley.
Many are the delightful trips which may
be taken here. They are all carefully
organized and conducted by guides who
know and love the place.</p>

<p>Before passing El Capitan we are attracted<a id='p108'></a>
by the exquisite Bridal Veil Falls
on the opposite side, higher than the highest
fall in Switzerland. On the same side
as El Capitan and beyond, we see the
Three Brothers; one of these peaks is accessible
by trail; from the summit (3,700 feet)
there is one of the finest views of the valley.
Next come the Cathedral Spires, and on
the south side Sentinel Rock and Sentinel
Dome. North and South Dome are most
curious and especially interesting. There
are trails leading to nearly all of these individual
crests now.</p>

<p>Of all the falls, the one called, like the
valley, Yosemite, is the finest. It is the
highest known fall of its volume. The
waters dash down one half mile. The fall
is in three sections, but appears all one at a
distance. In the early spring, when the
volume is greatest, the booming of the
waters is deafening and the force with
which it strikes the ground shakes windows
one mile away.</p>

<p>From Yosemite Point, the crest above
the falls, the view is magnificent, but for<a id='p109'></a>
the full effect of this fall one should walk
to the foot and look up; the sensation received
will not soon be forgotten.</p>

<p>The flora and fauna are enchanting.
There are scores of varieties of wild flowers,
shrubs, ferns, etc. To those interested in
the botany of the valley, “Yosemite
Flora,” issued by the Department of
Botany, University of California, will be of
great value.</p>

<p>Camping in the Yosemite is more popular
than life in the hotels, the camps are
provided with all the necessary comforts.
Full particulars can be had by writing to
the Sentinel Hotel, Camp Curry, Camp
Lost Arrow, or Camp Awahnee.</p>

<p>Before leaving the valley the Lower
Drive must surely be taken by those who
have not had time to take the trip on foot.
The valley is so small that the floor can be
pretty thoroughly explored (as far as mere
sight-seeing goes) in a single drive, and it
is most pleasing to carry away with us a
picture of this green spot, starred over with
the lovely wild flowers; it is like an oasis in<a id='p110'></a>
a desert. The trip up the trail on the
morrow, leading over the bare, brown face
of rocky cliffs, will have amid the white of
the everlasting snows and the sparkling of
the sunlight in the various falls, only the
occasional appearing and disappearing of
this emerald valley threaded by the silver
stream of the Merced to give it colour.
The climb to Glacier Point is made cross-saddle
only, and the traveller who has gone
out unprepared can rent a skirt by making
known her want when she engages her
horse or mule. But before starting on this
trip which is to take the traveller out of
the valley, I must mention the drive to the
lovely Tenaya Canyon and Mirror Lake.
This is usually taken in the early morning,
in time to see the sunrise, and fully does
it repay one; those planning to take the
Glacier Point Trail usually start this way
and from here pass Cathedral Rocks,
Clouds’ Rest, etc., to where the horses are
waiting for the start. Glacier Point is
7,297 feet above sea level, and between
3,000 and 4,000 feet above the valley.<a id='p111'></a>
The trail winds up the east end of the
valley, past the foot of the beautiful Vernal
Falls, and up, up, over the top, past the
splendid Nevada Falls and again over the
top, zigzagging back and forth, on every
turn new views greeting the sight. Liberty
Cap and Mount Star King, as seen from
the point on this trail known as Panorama
View, 4,000 feet above the valley, are more
impressive than words can tell.</p>

<p>At Glacier Point we find a comfortable
hotel, with a veranda which makes one
want to stay indefinitely, so wonderful is
the view seen from it, with the valley, the
falls, and ridge after ridge of the snow-clad
Sierras. From here there are fine
walks and many fine views to be had.</p>

<!-- :special 2 0 1 -->
<div class='c sa1 sb2'>WAWONA AND THE MARIPOSA GROVE</div>

<p>From Glacier Point the trip to Wawona
is made; the drive leads through beautiful
woods, via Wawona to the Mariposa Grove
of Big Trees, where the stage passes
through the living gateways that have
been cut through several of these monsters.<a id='p112'></a>
So much has been written and said of the
Big Trees that I can add nothing. I think
they are the most impressive sight, except
perhaps one or two spots in the Far East,
to be found in the world to-day, and while
these fine old monuments of Europe are
the dead ruins of a dead people, these
great trees are the living monuments of
a world that was old before Europe was
born.</p>

<div class='c sa1 sb2'>THE HETCH-HETCHY VALLEY</div>

<p>The Hetch-Hetchy Valley is now being
dammed below Kolana Rock, to supply
water to the city of San Francisco. Many
persons will recall the efforts which were
made by public-spirited citizens to prevent
this, and many are still mourning the loss
of this beautiful canyon as a playground,
but Robert Sterling Yard tells us, for our
comfort, that in prehistoric times the
valley was once a great lake, and that the
remains of Nature’s dam are not far from
the site of the dam which man is building
to-day. He adds that, with care, this restoration<a id='p113'></a>
may not work out so inappropriately
as once we feared.</p>

<p>To the north of the Hetch-Hetchy
Valley is the Tuolumne Canyon, famous for
its waterfalls, through which the Tuolumne
River flows to the lovely meadows of
the same name. These meadows in the
springtime are like stretches of marvellous
stained glass, or a freshly laid brilliant
mosaic, embedded in a surface of jade,
there is such a riot of colours from the wild
flowers growing here. The river winding
its way through the meadows descends in
a torrent to the Hetch-Hetchy Valley
almost 5,000 feet below.</p>

<div class='c sa1 sb2'>THE SEQUOIA NATIONAL PARK</div>

<p>“This park is the gateway to one of the
grandest scenic areas in this or any other
land.</p>

<p>“Of the 1,156,000 sequoias, young and
old, which form these groves, 12,000 exceed
10 feet in diameter, ‘General Sherman,’ the
largest known tree, being 36.5 feet in diameter
and 279.9 ft. in height. Its exact age<a id='p114'></a>
cannot be determined without counting
the rings, but it is probably in excess of
3,500 years. There are many thousand
trees in this park which were growing
thriftily when Christ was born, hundreds
which were flourishing while Babylon was
in its prime, several which antedate the
pyramids on the Egyptian Desert.</p>

<p>“Well outside the park boundaries and
overlooking it from the east, the amazing
craggy Sierras give birth in glacial chambers
to two noble rivers, the Kings River
and the Kern. The canyons of these
rivers are practically matchless for the
wild quality of their beauty and the majesty
of their setting.</p>

<p>“Unlike many areas of extreme rocky
character, this is not especially difficult to
travel, it curiously adapts itself to trails.
It is an ideal land for the camper, but one
must go well equipped. There must be
good guides, good horses, and plenty of
warm clothing.”<sup><a id='fn42r' href='#fn42'>2</a></sup></p>

<!-- :special 2 0 1 -->
<div class='c sa1 sb2'>MOUNT WHITNEY</div>

<p><a id='p115'></a>“The Sierra reaches its mightiest climax
a few miles east of the present Sequoia
National Park, in Mount Whitney, the
highest mountain in the United States.
Its altitude is 14,501 feet. The journey to
Whitney’s summit is a progress of inspiration
and climax.</p>

<p>“From Visalia automobiles carry one
under the very shadow of the Big Trees.
Over the park boundaries, into the magic of
the mountains; up to the headwaters of
the Kaweah; across the splendours of the
great Western Divide; into the Kern Valley,
then up winding passes, skirting precipices,
edging glaciers to the top.”<sup><a id='fn43r' href='#fn43'>3</a></sup></p>

<p>Mount Whitney lies some 90 miles south
of the Yosemite Valley. It is in this region
that Congress is considering setting apart
another large area, 1,600 square miles, to
be known as “Roosevelt National Park,”
which will embrace both the General Grant
and the Sequoia National Park.</p>

<p><a id='p116'></a>The General Grant Park is only 4 square
miles in area. It was created to protect
what is believed to be the second largest
tree in the world, “General Grant,” with
a diameter of 35 feet and a height of 264
feet.</p>

which is privately owned, and which separates
this park from the Sequoia National
Park, they would be one.</p>

<div class='c sa1 sb2'>ROOSEVELT NATIONAL PARK<br/> <span class='sm'>PROPOSED SITE</span></div>

<p>The section of California lying east and
south of the above chain of parks, the
Yosemite, the General Grant, and the
Sequoia, were it in any other state than
California, so full of scenic attractions,
would be the show place of the entire region,
but so far, to the average American
traveller, it is almost unknown. This great
Valley, so rich in beautiful rivers, lakes, and
canyons, is the proposed site of the Roosevelt
National Park.</p>

<p>In shape it is a long oval, lying north<a id='p117'></a>
and south, bounded on the east by the
Sierras, with such great peaks as Mount
Humphreys, 13,972 feet; Mount Darwin,
13,841 feet; Mount Winchell, 13,749 feet;
Split Mountain, 14,051 feet; Striped Mountain,
13,160 feet; Mount Buxton, 13,118
feet; Junction Peak, 13,902 feet; Mount
Tyndall, 14,025 feet; Mount Whitney,
14,501 feet; and Mount Langley, 14,042
feet. It is difficult to picture such a wall,
nine great mountains all connected by
jagged peaks of almost equal height. In
this valley are rivers of inconceivable
beauty, such as the Kings River, the Kern
River, and the Kaweah, each of which has
carved superb canyons and, forming lesser
rivers with their forks, has again carved
lesser canyons with them.</p>

<p>The Kings River, rising in the Sierras and
flowing southward, crosses the valley from
east to west almost at its centre, sending
tributaries in all directions. The Kings
River Canyon was called by Mr. Muir a
second Yosemite; one should have that
great naturalist’s gift of expression to describe<a id='p118'></a>
this region. The walls of the Kings
River Canyon are not as precipitous as
those of the Yosemite and there are not the
great falls, but the floor of the canyon is
wider and it is more extensive, and the
mountains are higher.</p>

<p>The Kings River has many branches,
such as the Roaring River, Arrow Creek,
Woods Creek, Bubbs Creek, Boulder Creek,
etc., etc., streams to gladden the heart of
any fisherman, and bordered by such
meadows as only mountain streams can
produce.</p>

<p>The main river consists of three forks
and it is hard to say which is the most
lovely. The canyon of the middle fork,
“The Tehipite,” is not as easily reached as
is the south, but, judging by what Mr.
Yard says of it, it is worth going through
a good deal to see it. This enthusiastic
nature lover, author of “The Book of
National Parks,” says: “Time will not
dim my memory of Tehipite Dome, the
august valley and the leaping, singing river
which it overlooks. Well short of the<a id='p119'></a>
Yosemite in the kind of beauty that plunges
the observer into silence, the Tehipite
Valley far excels it in bigness, power, and
majesty.</p>

<p>“Lookout Point on the north rim, a
couple of miles south of the Dome, gave us
our first sensation. Three thousand feet
above the river, it offered by far the grandest
valley view I have looked upon, for the
rim view into Yosemite by comparison is
not so grand, as it is beautiful.”</p>

<p>The Tehipite Dome, the same writer
tells us, compares favourably with El
Capitan in height and prominence, and it
occupies a similar position at the valley’s
western gate.</p>

<p>To the south fork of the Kings River the
traveller is taken to Sanger by the Southern
Pacific Railroad, and from there automobiles
run daily.</p>

<p>An electric line runs from Visalia to
Lemon Cove and there again one is met by
automobiles and driven to Juanita Meadows,
where camping accommodations
have been arranged and from whence innumerable<a id='p120'></a>
trails may be taken. If you
have gone via Hume and stopped in the
camp overnight, you may leave by pack
train early the next morning and make the
trip eastward, beside the river, to Horse
Corral, where you camp again, and the
third day, from Lookout Point, the descent
is made to the canyon. Passing down a
three-mile zigzag trail you make a drop of
more than three thousand feet, while one
beautiful view after another opens out
before you. At Cedar Creek the floor is
reached and the river crossed, then comes
the six-mile ride up the canyon to Camp
Kaweah, a most beautiful trip. At this
camp you may stop a day, a week, or indefinitely.
There are numberless lovely
spots to be visited, the rivers come tumbling
down the gorges in cascades, or in
filmy, lace-like falls, and five or six miles
farther on lies the picturesque Paradise
Valley. The trail to Bubbs Creek is one
of the finest, leading eastward and giving
the view of the great Sierras. A chain of
glacial lakes lies below the trail and back<a id='p121'></a>
of them the Kearsarge Pinnacles, University
Peak, etc. Look at your map of California
and see what a marvellous region this is.
It may be reached in various ways, either
by the “John Muir Trail” from the north,
or across the Kearsarge Pass, down to Independence
and Lone Pine; or again by going
back to Horse Corral, camping there and
leaving the next day for Alta Meadows,
across to Mineral King, over Franklin Pass,
and so down into the Kern Canyon.</p>

<p>The Kearsarge Pass is one of the highest
of all the Sierra passes, 12,056 feet. It is
literally on the sharp edge of the mountain
range, so narrow that we are told the
horse strides it, standing on both sides of
the range at once; here may be seen the
contrasting sides of this wonderful range,
the long, green slope of the west, and the
steep, bare, rocky descent of the east.</p>

<p>This great region (Roosevelt Park as we
hope it is to be), 1,600 square miles, will
include both the General Grant and the
Sequoia National Parks; a trail leads from
here to the Yosemite, California’s memorial<a id='p122'></a>
to Mr. Muir; nothing could have been more
appropriate, as the trail was the one way
by which Mr. Muir felt a man could know
this part of the world, either afoot, or on
horse or mule back. The southwestern
area is beautified by the Kaweah River and
its five forks, and rising between the Kaweah
and the Kern rivers is the Western
Divide. The Kern Valley is said by some
to exceed the Kings River Valley in beauty.</p>

<p>The southern portion of the whole great
interior basin of California is commonly
known as the San Joaquin Valley. It comprises
the San Joaquin, the Tulare, and the
Kern valleys. Its greatest length is 260
miles and its width from 30 to 40 miles.</p>

<p>The Coast Range on the west of the
valley has an average height of 1,700 feet,
and the base averages 65 miles in width.
The Sierra Nevada Range on the east rises,
as we have seen, to a much greater height.
Between these two ranges lies as well as the
San Joaquin, the Sacramento Valley. The
ranges are connected in the southern part
of the state at Tehachipi, and in the northern<a id='p123'></a>
at Mount Shasta. The length of the
combined valleys is about 450 miles and
the width is 55 miles. The Coast Range is
composed of a multitude of ridges, and is
intersected by numerous long, narrow, fertile
valleys, Los Angeles, Salinas, Santa
Clara, Sonoma, etc., etc.<a id='p124'></a></p>

north, and bounded on the east and west
as San Francisco is. The opening between
these two points, one mile wide, is the
Golden Gate, the world-famous entrance
to the beautiful San Francisco Bay. Those
entering by steamer get the best view of<a id='p125'></a>
this great gateway. The bay is 50 miles
long and five to ten miles wide, and provides
San Francisco with one of the finest
harbours in the world.</p>

<!-- :special 2 0 1 -->
<div class='c sa1 sb2'>SAN FRANCISCO BAY</div>

<p>The bay is magnificently fortified.
Points Lobos and Bonita are the two points
reaching out into the Pacific Ocean, the
former at the outer point of the crescent,
which forms Bonita Cove to the north,
and the latter at the outer point of the
crescent, which forms South Bay to the
south. These peninsulas extend like great
arms into the Pacific Ocean, forming the
outer bay. At the inner ends are Point
Diablo and Fort Point, both fortified
and impressive looking. Those who are
unable to see the bay from the water should
not fail to take the Presidio Drive, the
drive to the U. S. Military Reservation,
where the most wonderful view may be
had far out over the ocean.</p>

<p>The islands which lie in San Francisco
Bay and are the most noticeable from this<a id='p126'></a>
city are known as Alcatras, Angel, and
Yerba Buena Islands. They are the property
of the United States Government.</p>

<p>On Alcatras is the U. S. Military Prison.
A permit is necessary to visit the island;
permission may also be had to visit Angel
Island, where there is a recruiting station,
Fort McDowell. On Yerba Buena, known
as Goat Island, there is a Government
Naval Training School.</p>

<p>The U. S. Military Reservation, known
as The Presidio, comprises 1,500 acres,
and lies along the bay for four or five miles.
This stretch is strongly fortified. Here may
be seen Fort Winfield Scott, Fort McDowell,
Fort Baker, Fort Miley, and Fort Barry.</p>

<div class='c sa1 sb2'>THE GOLDEN GATE PARK</div>

<p>The Golden Gate Park, of more than
1,000   acres, may be reached by almost any
of the trolley lines; laid out on sand hills
and reclaimed ground, with one end fronting
on the Pacific Ocean, it is beautifully
planted with many unusual trees and
plants, shrubs and flowers, and has some<a id='p127'></a>
20 miles of the finest driveways. Points
of special interest are many: The Japanese
Tea Garden, which really looks
like a bit of old Japan. Here two dainty
little Japanese ladies serve tea. Admission
to the garden is free, but of course one pays
a small sum for the tea and rice cakes. A
military band plays in the park on Sundays
and holiday afternoons. There are some
good statues in the grounds: “The Wine
Press” by Thomas S. Clarke, near the
front of the museum, is unusually fine.
In the Memorial Museum there is an especially
good collection of Japanese ivories,
Indian basketry, and ceramics. The
Academy of Sciences Museum has very fine
groups of animals and birds of the Pacific
Coast. The Fern Glen must not be overlooked;
here may be seen, growing in the
open, lovely specimens of the tree fern.</p>

<p>On a small hill near Stone Lake stands
Prayer-book Cross, erected by Mr. George
William Childs, of Philadelphia, in commemoration
of the first English church
service held on this continent in 1579.<a id='p128'></a></p>

<!-- :special 2 0 1 -->
<div class='c sa1 sb2'>OCEAN BEACH</div>

<p>Ocean Beach is a favourite resort, sea
bathing goes on here the year round, but
by strong and expert swimmers only, the
currents being dangerous. From the beach
or the terrace in front of the Cliff House
the famous Seal Rocks are easily seen. Here
one is at times fortunate enough to he able
to watch the antics of scores of sea lions.</p>

<p>A little north of this are the Sutro
Baths and Sutro Gardens. The picturesque
Dutch windmills in the Golden Gate Park
were presented by a private citizen; they
furnish water for the lakes etc., in the park.
There are several very pretty artificial
lakes.</p>

<p>Of animals, there are about what the
usual park has, buffalo, deer, elk, etc.</p>

<div class='c sa1 sb2'>PANAMA-PACIFIC INTERNATIONAL EXPOSITION</div>

<p>The great Exposition which in 1915 celebrated
the opening of the Panama Canal<a id='p129'></a>
and which has now become a part of the
history of San Francisco, was held upon
the site now known as the Marina. This
site comprised a tract of approximately
625 acres, with almost three miles of waterfront.
So much has been written of the
beauty of the buildings, the grounds, the
statuary, etc., that it need not be repeated
here; those who saw it will not forget it and
those who were less fortunate will never
know just what they missed. Through the
efforts of the San Francisco Arts Association
the Fine Arts building has been saved
for a time; the state of California has taken
over the California building for a normal
school. The Exposition Preservation
League has plans for a fine boulevard
which is to extend from Fort Mason to the
Presidio, connecting with the present
boulevard in the Presidio.</p>

<div class='c sa1 sb2'>MOUNT TAMALPAIS</div>

<p>From San Francisco the trip to Mount
Tamalpais must be made, crossing the bay
to Sausalito and from there taking the<a id='p130'></a>
electric car to Mill Valley, where one
passes some charming homes. From here
the ascent is made (about eight miles) by
what we are told is the “crookedest” railroad
in the world. Superb views are had
during this climb, one moment looking out
across the blue waters of the bay, and the
next piercing the black depths of the forest,
only to turn again to the sparkling sunshine
in another moment. The view from
the summit fully repays one for the trip, the
Pacific Ocean stretching as far as the eye
can reach on the one side, with the ships
coming and going, and the San Francisco
Bay, with its fascinating shore lines, on the
other side.</p>

<!-- :special 2 0 1 -->
<div class='c sa1 sb2'>MUIR WOODS</div>

<p>From a station part way up Mount
Tamalpais a branch line runs to Muir
Woods, one of the most beautiful bits of
redwood forest to be seen anywhere. I
cannot worthily describe it, one must see it.
Possibly the greatest charm of the place
lies in the fact that these trees rise tall and<a id='p131'></a>
erect above what to us in the East would
be in itself a fine forest of oak, beech,
maple, etc., the rich, variegated foliage of
the deciduous trees making a most charming
contrast to the deep, dark green of
the redwood. The trees grow in circular
clusters, which are explained by the theory
that the present trees are all off-shoots
from giant trees which had stood there at
some time past. What giants they must
have been! These circles are from 30 to
60 feet in diameter, the trees themselves
are about 10 feet in diameter.</p>

<p>An exquisite stream flows through the
woods and there is a fine driveway, but
to enjoy it to the full one should walk
through. It is said that the redwood does
not thrive where the salt fog does not reach
it; here the soft, misty veil, which floats
over and filters into the woods from time
to time, is another of its charms.</p>

<p>It is to Mr. William Kent, one of California’s
most worthy citizens, that we owe
this National Monument. He bought it,
paying $80,000 for it, that it might not be<a id='p132'></a>
destroyed, and presented it to the United
States; having discovered an old law enabling
the United States to accept gifts of
“American Antiquities,” this collection
was presented and accepted as such. The
wish of the people was to call the woods,
Kent Woods, but the modest donor insisted
that it be named for Mr. John Muir,
and so it is that it appears upon the map
to-day as Muir Woods.</p>

<!-- :special 2 0 1 -->
<div class='c sa1 sb2'>BELVEDERE</div>

<p>Another delightful short trip from San
Francisco is to cross the bay to Belvedere.
This little mountain of a peninsula rises
up out of the water in the most picturesque
way, and is one of the loveliest spots anywhere
in this region. Beautiful homes,
built up and down the sides of the hills,
each with a garden more alluring than the
last, makes the whole seem a veritable
Eden. The planting goes down to the
water’s edge—a riot of colour, making the
whole seem one great garden, entwined
about and laced together by the exquisite<a id='p133'></a>
green tendrils of the soft mosses. Here are
trees of all sorts, and it seemed to me birds
of all sorts. A merry, happy, singing little
spot.</p>

<!-- :special 2 0 1 -->
<div class='c sa1 sb2'>MOUNT DIABLO</div>

<p>Mount Diablo is the peak which can be
seen in the distance due east from San
Francisco; it rises 3,850 feet above sea level.
A good automobile road leads to the summit,
and makes a favourite week-end drive.
The view from the summit is particularly
fine, because it is so extensive. On a clear
day a nickel-plated monument is visible,
through a telescope, on the summit of
Mount Shasta, 193 miles to the north,
while to the south one sees as far as Mount
Whitney, over the great Sacramento and
San Joaquin valleys.</p>

<!-- :special 2 0 1 -->
<div class='c sa1 sb2'>SONOMA</div>

<p>Sonoma, some 40 miles north of San
Francisco, reached by ferry and railway,
is interesting as being one of the chief
centres of the famous vine-growing district.<a id='p134'></a>
In this region is Santa Rosa, the home of
Luther Burbank, where he has large experimental
gardens. Extensive work is also
done on his farm eight miles west of Santa
Rosa, near Sebastopol, called the Gold
Ridge Proving Grounds. The farm is, I
believe, open to visitors. While at Santa
Rosa it is interesting to see the church
which is built of the wood of one redwood
tree.</p>

<!-- :special 2 0 1 -->
<div class='c sa1 sb2'>OAKLAND</div>

<p>Oakland, five miles from San Francisco,
is reached by ferry, and from there we go to
Berkeley, the seat of the University of
California. There are several entrances
to the university grounds, and visitors are
admitted by any of them. The university
is delightfully situated on the lower slopes
of the Berkeley Hills. The site comprises
about 530 acres of land, which rises gradually
from 200 feet above sea level to 1,300
feet. The university is well endowed,
tuition is free to residents of California.
There is to be in time a very fine collection
of buildings, many of which have already<a id='p135'></a>
been put up. The chief sight-seeing features
of the university are the Greek
Theatre, which seats 10,000 people, and
the Campanile. There are in these grounds
wonderful old oaks said to be thousands of
years old; extremes in the tree family meet
when one compares these bent, gnarled
gray oaks with the tall, straight dignity of
the eucalyptus trees growing round the
theatre. There are several statues in the
grounds, but one in bronze, by Douglas
Tilden, who is deaf and dumb, which is
known as the Football Player, is especially
virile.</p>

<div class='c sa1 sb2'>LELAND STANFORD UNIVERSITY</div>

<p>A fine automobile road leads from San
Francisco through San Mateo and Palo
Alto, to the Leland Stanford University,
California’s other great centre of learning,
which, it is well known, was built by Mr.
and Mrs. Leland Stanford as a memorial
to their only child.</p>

<p>The driveway, of about one mile from the
entrance to the main buildings, is charmingly<a id='p136'></a>
planted with palms; the grounds are
beautifully kept, and the cactus garden is
most interesting. The group of buildings
is probably as fine as any in this country.
The architecture is an adaptation of the
old Spanish Mission architecture, with long
colonnades, graceful arches, and picturesque
red tile roofing. The inner quadrangle
consists of twelve one-story buildings and
the Memorial Church, connected by a
continuous open arcade. The decorations
of the church are very ornate; they were
terribly damaged by the earthquake in
1906, but are now entirely restored.</p>

<!-- :special 2 0 1 -->
<div class='c sa1 sb2'>SANTA CLARA AND MOUNT HAMILTON</div>

<p>Journeying southward from here we come
to Santa Clara, where there is an old
mission. From there to San José (Ho-sai)
one gets interesting glimpses of the famous
prune-growing district in the lovely, fertile
Santa Clara Valley where they claim to
have the largest fruit-packing house in the
world. San José, a little farther south, is
one of the old historic towns; from here<a id='p137'></a>
there are a number of trips to be made, the
most important being to Mount Hamilton,
to see the Lick Observatory; stages leave
San José daily, the trip is very lovely and
full of interest. For those who can spare
the time, Saturday is the day to go up, as
that night visitors are allowed to use the
telescope. There is a little inn not far
from the observatory where the traveller
is taken care of. This observatory was
built and endowed by a Californian, James
Lick, whose body is buried under the great
telescope. The observatory now belongs
to the University of California, and possesses
the second most powerful refracting
telescope in existence.</p>

<!-- :special 2 0 1 -->
<div class='c sa1 sb2'>SANTA CRUZ</div>

<p>Santa Cruz is delightfully situated at
the north end of the Monterey Bay. All
of these places can be reached nowadays
by automobile as well as by the Southern
Pacific Coast Line; there are many companies
that run excursions down the coast,
using large, comfortable cars and arranging<a id='p138'></a>
for a certain amount of small baggage; at
any of the hotels this information is given.
Of course the automobile is the ideal
mode of travel these days, but it is
especially so in the West, where there
is something to see on all sides, and up
and down the coast, from Vancouver to
San Diego.</p>

<p>Going to the California State Redwood
Park, we leave the main line at Felton and
take a branch road to Boulder Creek,
where the stage line starts; this is a reservation
of 7,000 acres, and as beautiful a bit
of woodland as one could ask to see, covered
with trees larger than those of the Muir
Woods. Here, as elsewhere, camps are
provided, and the traveller is made most
comfortable for a day, a week, or a month,
as he chooses.</p>

<p>Monterey is situated at the extreme
south of this lovely Monterey Bay; this is
one of the most interesting spots in the
state historically, and is full of old landmarks.
It was the capital of California
until 1849. Perhaps the most interesting<a id='p139'></a>
of the old buildings is the Spanish Customs
House. The first opera house of the
state is pointed out, and we are told that
Jenny Lind sang there. The house in
which Robert Louis Stevenson lived is
pointed out, etc., etc.</p>

<div class='c sa1 sb2'>PINNACLES NATIONAL MONUMENT</div>

<p>“Forty miles east of Monterey, in a
spur of the low Coast Range, is a region
which erosion has carved into many fantastic<a id='p140'></a>
shapes. Because of its crowded,
pointed rocks, it has been set apart as a
national monument, under the above
title, though it has long been known as
Vancouver’s Pinnacles because the great
explorer visited it while his ships lay at
anchor in Monterey Bay, and afterward
described it in his ‘Voyages and Discoveries.’</p>

<p>“Two deep gorges, bordered by fantastic
walls 600 to 1,000 feet high, and a broad
semi-circular, flower-grown amphitheatre,
constitute the central feature.”<sup><a id='fn44r' href='#fn44'>4</a></sup></p>

<p>The best approach is from Gilroy, which
lies between San José and Monterey.</p>

<p>The Hotel Del Monte, at Del Monte,
is one of the most famous on the Pacific
Coast; the hotel and its gardens are among
the show places of this region. This is perhaps
the best known point from which to
take the famous 17-mile drive, a drive
which though still called by the old name
has been extended to many times that
length, and is a very beautiful beach
drive, one not to be missed by those who
are in this region.</p>

<p>At Pacific Grove there are lovely beaches,
and here, as at Santa Catalina Island,
the glass-bottomed boats are enjoyed, from
which we seem to peep into Fairyland; as we
gaze down through the clear salt water those
charming lines of Percival’s come to us:</p>

just a short drive from Monterey,
there is an unusually beautiful beach, the
sand is of dazzling whiteness; here there are
two hotels, and those who like a quiet,
restful place will revel in this spot. The
old mission here is of exceptional interest,
being the burial place of Padre Junipero
Serra, the first of the Franciscan Monks
who entered California, and established the
first of their missions for the Indians in
1769.</p>

<p>Continuing southward we come to Paso
Robles Hot Springs, which rank among the

springs. These baths are wonderful,
curatively as well as architecturally. The
Indians are said to have brought their sick
here from all the surrounding country.
Splendid cures from the mud baths at this
place have been reported. The swimming
pool is an unusually fine one. This is a

<div class='lg sa2'>SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA</div>
</div>

<p>Travelling south, by either train
or automobile, when one runs into
the lovely Santa Barbara country,
there is a feeling of satisfaction. The
coast faces due south and the mountains
rising back of the valley protect it from the
cold winds. For more than a hundred
miles the sea is in full view.</p>

<p>Before reaching Santa Barbara the
Santa Ynez Mountains are crossed; from
the crest of this range there is a fine view
of the four islands which bound the Santa
Barbara Channel. The roads are of the
best, the air is like champagne, the sun is
sure to be bright, and altogether this is a
most satisfying drive.</p>

<p>Ventura is the town for the Mission San
Buenaventura, very picturesque and in<a id='p144'></a>
pretty good preservation. At Carpinteria
we are shown what we are told is the
largest grapevine in the world, not as old
as the famous vine at Hampton Court,
England, but much larger. Here also, in a
beautiful spot near the beach, the home of
the author, Stewart Edward White, is
pointed out.</p>

<p>Santa Barbara, that lovely place called
by many the Mentone of our country, is
particularly happily situated. Nestled at
the foot of the Santa Ynez Mountains, it
is entirely protected by them from the
north and west winds, and here the blue
waters of the Pacific Ocean, the lovely
coast and wonderful sunshine, flowers, and
ocean bathing may be enjoyed just as on
the Riviera these joys of the Mediterranean
are to be found. This is one of the most
charming resorts in all this resort-filled
state. At Santa Barbara there is another
very fine old mission. There are numerous
trips to be made in this region. The beautiful
Cliff Drive; the San Marco Pass;
the Santa Ynez Valley, etc., etc. The sea<a id='p145'></a>
trips to the islands should also be made.
Santa Cruz and Santa Rosa are most interesting,
and here may be found fine
specimens of the Abalone shells.</p>

<p>Beverly Hills is a delightful suburb,
where there is a fine modern hotel, Beverly
Hills Hotel, and where every comfort may
be had. This place stands up in such a
way that one seems to get more than the
ordinary share of bracing salt air; the
Pacific Electric Line runs between here and
Los Angeles. A little farther on, by the
same line, Santa Monica is reached; this is
a popular resort, with various places of
amusement, built on a bluff overlooking
the ocean from which there is a view of the
long, white, sandy beach, which leads on to
Ocean Park, a popular resort on the order
of Atlantic City, N. J.</p>

<p>San Pedro, the fine Los Angeles port,
some 20 miles from the centre of the city
and reached by the Pacific Electric, or any
one of the various railroads of that region, is
the starting place for Santa Catalina Island.
Comfortable steamers make the trip in<a id='p146'></a>
about two hours. It may be as smooth a
crossing as any one could desire, but again
I have seen it very rough. It is a beautiful
sail almost due south; one is strongly
reminded of the Mediterranean Sea here,
with the deep blue of the water and the
mountainous island rising right from the
sea. The first view of Santa Catalina
rejoices the soul, especially if one chances
to approach it through one of the soft
white mists which at times hang over these
waters. This was the case on the day of
my first trip there—the mist lifting and
rolling away, while we were still some miles
off—the full splendour of the noonday sun
bringing out the island as we stood in the
bow of the approaching ship. “Santa
Catalina is in reality a range of mountains
23 miles long and sufficiently rugged in
its upper reaches to win the devotion of
the most venturesome. The highest
peak, Orizaba, has an elevation of 2,700
feet. For genuine excitement the visitor
will choose a trip to the crags to hunt
the wild goats. Horses, guides, rifles, and<a id='p147'></a>
other necessaries are obtainable on the
island.”<sup><a id='fn45r' href='#fn45'>5</a></sup></p>

<p>This is a spot which would satisfy any
one, from the hunter out for adventure, to
the frailest invalid, with a desire only for a
warm, sunny, peaceful spot in which to
rest and grow strong.</p>

<p>The land slopes gently down to the
water’s edge. The landward side of the
island, being shaped like a great crescent,
presents to the gaze of the approaching
visitor a lovely green amphitheatre in the
centre of which stands the Hotel Metropole
(there are countless hotels, boarding-houses,
and camps), to the left the Open Air
Theatre, where the band plays each evening.
There is an incline road, which takes
to the top of the mountain those who do
not care to climb. Trails lead off on every
side. The Aquarium, though only a small
beginning, has some rare specimens. The
glass-bottomed boats are a never-ending
source of delight, the small ones can be
rented for very little, and one sits<a id='p148'></a>
spellbound, gazing down into the marine gardens,
watching the exquisitely coloured
fish as they pass silently to and fro, brilliant
blue in the sunshine, dark in the
shadow, while the glint of the goldfish now
here, now there, never ceases.</p>

<div class='c sa1 sb2'>LOS ANGELES</div>

<p>Los Angeles, the metropolis of southern
California, lies about 15 miles inland. It is a<a id='p149'></a>
fine, prosperous city, of almost unprecedentedly
rapid growth.</p>

<p>Los Angeles County is one of the great
fruit-growing centres, the valleys being
fairly covered with vineyards; orange,
lemon, and olive groves also abound here.</p>

<p>The residences, in and about the city,
are famous for their beautiful gardens.
The parks are fine and well kept, and the
public play grounds are the most fascinating
I have ever seen. There is an interesting
ostrich farm, opposite Eastlake Park,
where these birds of all ages may be seen.
There are trips to be made on all sides, but
here, as elsewhere, the hotels provide all
sorts of circulars, telling in detail of the
surrounding country. In California one
can hardly take the wrong turn, for there is
something worth seeing in every direction.</p>

<p>Pasadena, about ten miles northeast of
Los Angeles, lies in the lovely, fertile valley
of San Gabriel, where thousands of tourists
come annually to the Floral Parade and
Rose Tournament. More beautiful homes
can be seen here than in any other one place<a id='p150'></a>
in California. The city is charmingly
planted. Its avenues, the finest of which
is Marengo Avenue, with its exquisite
pepper trees on either side, presents a picture
hard to equal. Many of the sunken
gardens belonging to private residences
we were allowed to visit; we found them all
they had ever been said to be.</p>

<p>To the north of Pasadena is Mount
Lowe. This trip is made from Los Angeles
by electric, and takes about two hours.
The car stops at Pasadena for passengers
from there, then very soon begins to run
upgrade and into the Rubio Canyon, where
we leave the electric and take a cable car
up to Echo Mountain, 3,500 feet above sea
level, where a really superb view lies spread
before us on all sides. From Echo a car
runs to Alpine Tavern, quite an exciting
bit of the trip, following in places the very
edge of the precipice. The tavern, they
tell us, is 5,000 feet above sea level; from
here there are several delightful trails, all
ending in superb views, extending many
miles in every direction.<a id='p151'></a></p>

<p>Mount Wilson is a little to the southeast
of Mount Lowe, and makes another interesting
excursion. Like Mount Lowe,
it is reached by electric, which takes one
almost to the top. The last bit can be
made on foot. Here again are fine views,
and on the summit we find the Carnegie
Solar Observatory, with the largest solar
reflecting telescopes in the world. Those
wishing to remain overnight can do so;
there is a small hotel.</p>

<div class='c sa1 sb2'>RIVERSIDE</div>

<p>About two hours out of Los Angeles,
situated in the centre of one of the most
famous orange-growing regions, is the city
of Riverside, one of the most attractive of
the many charming places which surround
Los Angeles.</p>

<p>The Mission Inn is worth going a long
way to see, it is an exceptionally fine bit
of the always-pleasing Spanish-Mission
architecture; the central court, or patio,
has unusual charm, with its very beautiful<a id='p152'></a>
planting; there is a famous old orange tree
here.</p>

<p>The city is built in the Santa Ana
Valley, from which the hills roll up on all
sides. By driving or walking to the summit
of one of these hills an extensive view
of the valley may be had. On one of
the drives we come upon a tablet set into
a boulder, upon which may be read the
following words written by that dear nature
lover whom all the West loves to quote:</p>

<p>“Climb the mountains and get their
good tidings. Nature’s peace will flow
into you as sunshine flows into the trees.
The winds will blow their own freshness
into you and the storms their energy, while
cares will drop off like autumn leaves.”</p>

<div class='c sa1 sb2'>SAN DIEGO</div>

<p>San Diego is the most southern port on
the west coast of the United States, it was
one of the earliest settlements on this coast.</p>

<p>The city has a very good harbour, which
is as interesting to the tourist as it is commercially,
for there are many good trips<a id='p153'></a>
to be made by water here; the kelp beds
are especially interesting.</p>

<p>The climate of San Diego is famous; it
is said to be equally delightful the year
round, and much is being done to make the
city attractive. Six thousand acres have
been set aside as parkland; the finest is
Balboa Park, where the beautiful buildings
erected for the Panama-California Exposition,
1915, still stand.</p>

<p>Coronado Beach, with its great Hotel
Del Coronado, is one of the most famous of
year-round resorts. The beach, some 15
miles long, lies on the peninsula which
forms the outer arm of the San Diego Bay,
and is a very beautiful stretch. The hotel,
like the Del Monte at Monterey, is set in
a tropical garden; the flower beds, great
sheets of colour, are an endless delight to
the Easterner; here may be enjoyed every
luxury of modern life with all the ease and
freedom of the tropics.</p>

<p>In the old town one may see the Estudillo
House, made famous by Helen Hunt Jackson
as the place where Ramona was married.<a id='p154'></a>
This is a very picturesque spot, the
courtyard especially so, and in the garden
the old oven still stands.</p>

<p>Point Loma, a small peninsula which
juts into the ocean at the most northern
point of San Diego Bay, should be visited;
fine views can be had from the point, and
interesting caves, on the ocean side, are
visited en route. “The Theosophical Institute
of Universal Brotherhood” is on
this peninsula. Here, under the leadership
of Katharine Tingley, this society has established
itself and its model school. The
colony is open to tourists. The architecture
is unusual.</p>

<div class='c sa1 sb2'>THE AMERICAN SAHARA</div>

<p>The Great American Desert was almost
better known a generation ago than it is
to-day. Then the hardy Argonauts traversed
that fearful waste on foot with their
dawdling ox trains, and hundreds of them
left their bones to bleach in that thirsty
land. The survivors of these deadly journeys
had a very definite idea of what that<a id='p155'></a>
desert was, but now that we can cross it
in a day in Pullman cars, its real and still-existing
horrors are largely forgotten.</p>

<p>“The first scientific exploration of this
deadly area was Lieutenant Wheeler’s
United States survey in the early fifties;
and he was the first to give scientific assurance
that we have here a desert as absolute
as the Sahara. It is full of strange, burnt,
ragged mountain ranges, with deceptive,
sloping, broad valleys between. There are
countless extinct volcanoes upon it and
hundreds of square miles of black, bristling
lava flows. The summer heat is inconceivable,
often reaching 136 degrees in
the shade; even in winter the mid-day
heat is sometimes insufferable, while at
night ice frequently forms on the water
tanks.</p>

<p>“There are oases in the desert, chief of
which are the narrow valleys of the Mojave
River and the lower Colorado. It is a
strange thing to see these soft green ribbons
athwart the molten landscape.</p>

<p>“The Arabian simoon is not deadlier<a id='p156'></a>
than the sandstorm of the Colorado Desert
(as the lower half is generally called).
Man or beast caught in one of these
sand-laden tempests has little chance of
escape.</p>

<p>“In the southern portions of the desert
are many strange freaks of vegetable life—huge
cacti 60 feet tall and as large around
as a barrel, with singular arms, which make
them look like giant candelabra; smaller
but equally fantastic varieties of cactus,
from the tall, lithe Ocalilla, or whipstock
cactus, down to the tiny knob smaller than
a china cup. There are countless more
modest flowers, too, and in the rainy season
thousands of square miles are carpeted
with a floral carpet, which makes it hard
for the traveller to believe that he is really
gazing upon a desert.</p>

<p>“This American Sahara is more than
1,500 miles long from north to south and
nearly half as wide. The most fatally
famous part is Death Valley, in California.”<sup><a id='fn47r' href='#fn47'>7</a></sup></p>

<p>The Colorado Desert is best known to
many of us through George Wharton
James’ fascinating book called: “The
Wonders of the Colorado Desert”; according
to this writer there is here a wealth of
pleasure awaiting those who care to enter
into the silent places of nature.</p>

<p>Probably the most attractive, as well as
the most convenient, points from which to
make the trip into the real desert are Riverside
and Redlands, passing through Nature’s
magnificent gateway, which lies between
the San Jacinto and San Bernardino
Ranges. The most satisfactory way to
make this trip is on horseback, with camping
outfit. Such trips are not for those
who are dependent upon modern hotel
comforts.</p>

<p>Mr. James says: “In the desert the
soul of man finds itself as nowhere else on
earth. On every hand are strange, wonderful,
beautiful things. No hall of necromancers
can equal the desert in its marvels
and revelations. Wonder follows wonder
in quick succession, etc.”<a id='p158'></a></p>

<!-- :special 2 0 1 -->
<div class='c sa1 sb2'>MISSIONS</div>

<p>The Encyclopedia Britannica says:</p>

<p>“The Jesuit Missionaries entered California
in 1697 and established their first
mission at Loreto, continuing to spread
these missions until 1767, when they were
expelled from the country by order of
Charles III of Spain and all their property
was turned over to the Franciscan Monks,
who later moved north to upper California....
Mexico’s becoming independent
of Spain in 1822 was the death-blow to the
establishment of the Franciscans, which
finally broke up in 1840 after they had
founded twenty-one missions.”</p>

<p>Many of these old buildings have been
restored and are in a fine state of preservation
to-day; they have had a distinct effect
upon the architecture of California. The
picturesque Spanish lines are particularly
suitable to this climate, where the open
courts and the beautiful arcades have a
perpetual background of blue sky, with
the clear, sparkling atmosphere of California.<a id='p159'></a>
It is impossible in a very limited
space to give a description of each mission,
and there are various books to be had on
the subject—“In and Out of the Old
Missions of California,” by George Wharton
James; “The Missions of California
and the Old Southwest,” by Jesse S. Hildrup,
etc. A delightful trip is made by
motor, visiting each in turn; they are,
mentioning them in order from the most
southern up, as they follow the coastline,
San Diego, San Luis Rey, San Juan Capistrano,
San Gabriel, Los Angeles, San
Buenaventura, Santa Barbara, Santa Ynez,
La Purisima Concepcion, San Luis Obispo,
San Miguel, San Antonio, Mission Soledad,
San Carlos, San Juan Bautista, Santa
Cruz, Santa Clara, San José, Mission
Dolores, San Rafael Archangel, Mission
San Francisco Solano.</p>

<p>These missions were built a day’s walk
apart in order that the travellers on foot
could always find shelter at the end of a
day’s tramp. In Los Angeles there is
given each year a mission play commemorating<a id='p160'></a>
this period in the history of California.
An ambulatory surrounding the playhouse
shows models of all the missions in
their order; a visit to this place and witnessing
a performance of the play will do
much toward impressing upon the tourist
the early settlement of this part of the
west coast.<a id='p161'></a></p>

<div class='sm sa1 sb4' id='p5c1'>CHAPTER ONE</div>
<div id='p163' class='lg sa2'>THE GRAND CANYON</div>
</div>

<p>The Grand Canyon of the Colorado
is the world’s most famous gorge, in
which Mr. Lummis says: “All the
world’s famous gorges could be lost forever.”</p>

<p>Charles Dudley Warner said of this
spot: “Human experience has no prototype
of this region, and the imagination has
never conceived of its forms and colours....
The scene is one to strike dumb
with awe, or to unstring the nerves....
All that we could comprehend was a vast
confusion of amphitheatres and strange
architectural forms resplendent with colour....
Streaks of solid hues 1,000 feet in
width, yellows mingled with white and gray,
orange, dull red, brown, blue, carmine, and
green all blending in the sunlight into one
transcendent effusion of splendour.”<a id='p164'></a></p>

<p>Here is truly one of the most marvellous
nature wonders of the world, and comparatively
few of us have seen it. It is
stupendous! It is incomprehensible!</p>

<p>The canyon lies chiefly in Arizona,
though Utah, Nevada, and California touch
each a corner. It is nearly 300 miles long
and in places 6,600 feet deep; the width
at the top is from 8 to 20 miles. The river
lying below is in places 300 feet wide, and
is 2,400 feet above sea level; yet looking
down from the rim it seems the smallest
stream, the merest thread.</p>

<p>The Santa Fé trains run twice a day
to the canyon.<sup><a id='fn51r' href='#fn51'>1</a></sup> There is a fine, big hotel,
the El Tovar, with every modern comfort,
built on a site 7,000 feet above sea level and
quite near the rim, commanding such a
view as can hardly be equalled in the
world.</p>

<p>Mr. C. A. Higgins in his “The Titan of
Chasms,” says: “Stolid indeed is he who
can front the awful scene and view its
unearthly splendour of colour and form<a id='p165'></a>
without quaking knee or tremulous breath.
An inferno swathed in soft, celestial fires;
a whole chaotic under-world, just emptied
of primeval floods and waiting for a new
creative word; eluding all sense of perspective
or dimension, outstretching the faculty
of measurement, overlapping the confines
of definite apprehension; a boding, terrible
thing, unflinchingly real, yet spectral as a
dream.... A labyrinth of huge architectural
forms, endlessly varied in design,
fretted with ornamental devices,
festooned with lace-like webs formed of
talus from the upper cliffs and painted with
every colour known to the palette in pure,
transparent tones of marvellous delicacy.</p>

<p>“A canyon, truly, but not after the
accepted type. An intricate system of
canyons, rather.... Only by descending
into the canyon may one arrive
at anything like comprehension of its proportions,
and the descent cannot be too
urgently recommended to every visitor who
is sufficiently robust to bear a reasonable
amount of fatigue.”<a id='p166'></a></p>

<p>There are several paths down the southern
wall of the canyon, and the trip is
safely made on horseback. A word of
advice here in regard to clothing may be of
use. It is absolutely necessary to have
good, warm clothing with one, for the night,
which is spent on the floor; but for the
descent a light shade hat is advisable; the
heat of the afternoon sun can be very
oppressive.</p>

<p>Mr. William Winter said of the Grand
Canyon: “It is a pageant of ghastly
desolation and yet of frightful vitality,
such as neither Dante nor Milton in their
most sublime conceptions ever even approached....
Your heart is moved
with feeling that is far too deep for words.
Hour after hour you would sit, entranced,
at the edge of this mighty subterranean
spectacle, lost in the wonder and glory of
it, forgetful of self, and conscious only of
the Divine Spirit.”</p>

<p>“If the falls of Niagara were installed
in the Grand Canyon between your visits—and
you knew it by the newspapers—next<a id='p167'></a>
time you stood on that dizzy rimrock
you would probably need good field-glasses
and much patience before you could locate
that cataract which in its place looks pretty
big. If Mount Washington were plucked
up bodily by the roots—not from where
you see it, but from sea level—and carefully
set down in the Grand Canyon, you
probably would not notice it next morning,
unless its dull colours distinguished it in
that innumerable congress of larger and
painted giants.</p>

<p>“All this, which is literally true, is a mere
trifle of what might be said in trying to fix
a standard of comparison for the Grand
Canyon. But I fancy there is no standard
adjustable to the human mind. You may
compare all you will—eloquently and from
wide experience—and at last all similes
fail. The Grand Canyon is just the Grand
Canyon, and that is all you can say. I
never have seen any one who was prepared
for it. I never have seen any one who could
grasp it in a week’s hard exploration; nor
any one, except some rare Philistine, who<a id='p168'></a>
could even think he had grasped it. I have
seen people rave over it; better people
struck dumb with it; even strong men who
wept over it; but I have never yet seen the
man or woman who expected it.”<sup><a id='fn52r' href='#fn52'>2</a></sup></p>

<p>Last, but by no means least, let me
quote a few words from an article published
in the <i>Century Magazine</i> by Mr. John
Muir:</p>

<p>“It seems a gigantic statement for even
Nature to make, all in one stone word.
Wildness so Godful, cosmic, primeval,
bestows a new sense of earth’s beauty and
size.... But the colours, the living,
rejoicing colours, chanting, morning and
evening, in chorus to heaven. Whose
brush or pencil, however lovingly inspired,
can give us these? In the supreme flaming
glory of sunset the whole canyon is transfigured,
as if all the life and light of centuries
of sunshine stored up in the rocks
was now being poured forth as from one
glorious fountain, flooding both earth and
sky.”</p>

<p><a id='p169'></a>It is a happy thing to be able to quote
such men as the above, for I am among the
number of those who were struck dumb
by the sight of this place. I can find no
words which would give any idea of the
impression made upon me by the canyon,
I can only advise those planning a western
trip to see it, without fail, either going or
returning; the time of the year does not
matter, the El Tovar is open to you the
year round.</p>

<!-- :special 2 0 1 -->
<div class='c sa1 sb2'>THE PAINTED DESERT</div>

<p>Among the interesting trips in this region
is that to the Painted Desert, of which one
hears little, probably because it is a difficult
trip; still it is perfectly possible for any
ordinarily hardy traveller. Five to seven
days should be allowed for the journey
which is made on horse- or mule-back.
The descent to the floor of the canyon is a
rough ride and very fatiguing, but by no
means dangerous. The trail leads down
canyon after canyon, dropping lower and
lower, for it must be remembered that the<a id='p170'></a>
Painted Desert lies 200 feet below sea level,
while the rim of the canyon from which
we start is 7,000 feet above sea level.
One can readily imagine the change in
temperature in such a descent (mentioned
elsewhere); the mercury stands at times
at 115°; however, those who care to put
up with the hardships are likely to feel
themselves fully repaid.</p>

<p>An experienced guide is necessary, especially
on account of the quicksands
which must be avoided in crossing the
Little Colorado River. The colours of the
sand, the mountains, and the sky are indescribable;
they are so brilliant as to
seem absolutely unreal, while beyond in
the distance is seen, in all its dazzling
whiteness of snow-capped peaks, the lovely
San Francisco range, a fitting background
for this mad riot of colour.</p>

<!-- :special 2 0 1 -->
<div class='c sa1 sb2'>PETRIFIED FOREST<br/> <span class='sm'>(NATIONAL MONUMENT)</span></div>

<p>“The Fossil Forest of Arizona, one of the
most remarkable features of a state noted<a id='p171'></a>
for its scenic wonders, is situated a few
miles south of Adamana, a station on the
Santa Fé Railroad in Apache County....
Only within a few years have
accommodations and transportation facilities
been such as to tempt more than a very
small proportion of the tourists and travellers
to ‘stop off’ on their through tickets
to the Grand Canyon and Pacific Coast.
Since the setting aside of the area as a
national monument, and the appointment
of a superintendent, the way has become
easy, and the constantly increasing number
of visitors has made the preparation of some
form of scientific account of the Forest
almost a necessity.”</p>

<p>This Mr. George Perkins Merrill follows
with a careful geological account of the
forest, which can be had by those who
wish to go carefully into the matter.</p>

<p>Here, as in the Great Petrified Forest
in the Arabian Desert, so called to distinguish
it from the one near Cairo, known
as the Petrified Forest, the trees are fallen
and lie prone upon the ground, glittering<a id='p172'></a>
fragments of carnelian and jasper all about
them. There are not even standing stumps
here, as in the Great Petrified Forest of the
Arabian Desert and the Yellowstone Forests
where superb specimens still may be
seen.</p>

<p>There are within the reservation four
forests, but the first is the one most generally
visited. This first is about six miles
from Adamana; it is easily reached in an
hour and a half. The second forest is two
and one half miles south of the first, the
trip taking about half an hour each way.
The third forest covers a greater area than
the others, it is 13 miles southwest of Adamana
and 18 miles southeast of Holbrook.
The third forest, known as the Rainbow
Forest, is the principal one; it is often called
Chalcedony Park. The ground here seems
strewn with jewels, and one has the feeling
of being in an enchanted spot; the colours
are most brilliant; chalcedony, opals, and
agates are found here.</p>

<p>One of the most interesting features of
this region is the Natural Bridge, consisting<a id='p173'></a>
of a great petrified trunk of jasper
and agate lying across a canyon 60 feet
wide and 20 feet deep, and forming a
foot-bridge over which any one may easily
pass.<a id='p174'></a></p>

<div class='lg sa1'>HISTORIC PLACES IN NEW MEXICO AND ARIZONA</div>

<!-- :special 2 0 1 -->
<div class='sa2'>NEW MEXICO</div>
</div>

<p>“Here we begin to realize that this
is an old country rather than a
new. Americans are prone to talk
about the ‘Settlement Period,’ of Bradford
and Brewster, of Captain John Smith and
Henry Hudson. But it is well to remember
that nearly a century before the <i>Half
Moon</i> sailed up the Hudson or the <i>Mayflower</i>
dropped her anchor in Massachusetts
Bay, the mailed warriors of Cabeza de
Vaca and Coronado had discovered the
terraced cities of Zuni, where men were
clothed in cotton and wool of their own
weaving, lived in stone houses, and cultivated
the soil.”<a id='p175'></a></p>

<p>At Albuquerque we find ourselves in a
half-American and half-Mexican city. It
is a junction point of the Santa Fé and the
metropolis of New Mexico. Many travellers
stop here for a day or two, to break
their journey.</p>

<p>The Alvarado, a Harvey hotel, has a fine
collection of Indian relics and products and
here one is likely to see the Navajo and
Hopi weavers, potters, silversmiths, and
basketmakers at work.</p>

<p>“Santa Fé lies at the base of a mountain
range nearly 2,000 feet higher than Albuquerque,
a few miles off the main line of
travel, on a branch line. Lamy is the
main line junction point, where one changes
cars to reach Santa Fé. When first visited
by the Spanish, about 1540 (a century before
Boston was settled), the town was a
populous Indian pueblo. You may read
its varied history in the guide books and
study its priceless records in the old territorial
‘Palace.’ The Casa Viejo, or old
house, where Coronado is said to have
lodged in 1540, and the church of San<a id='p176'></a>
Miguel, which was sacked in 1680, are not
distinguishable from their surroundings by
any air of superior age. All is old, a bit of
desiccated Granada of the 16th century.”</p>

<!-- :special 2 0 1 -->
<div class='c sa1 sb2'>HOPILAND, WOLPI AND ORAIBI</div>

<p>“There are many ways of getting into
the Hopi country, but there are three commonly
used routes, each of which has certain
advantages. At the starting-point of
each one of them conveyances may easily be
secured for the trip. The three points are
the stations of Holbrook, Winslow, and
Canyon Diablo, all along the line of the
Santa Fé. The Hopi country stretches out
north of these three stations; the distance
is about the same from each. Holbrook
possesses one advantage over the other
two routes: the town is situated on
the Hopi side of the Little Colorado
River; consequently, the question as to
whether the river is fordable need not be
considered.</p>

<p>“The distance from Holbrook to Wolpi,
the easternmost of the Hopi villages, is<a id='p177'></a>
about 80 miles. This trip, with camping
outfit, usually requires about three days.</p>

<p>“Winslow, a much larger town than Holbrook,
is a division point on the Santa Fé,
and has several hotels and livery stables.
Of the latter the writer is able to recommend,
from much personal experience, that
kept by Mr. Creswell. The route from
Winslow to Oraibi, the westernmost village,
is not quite 80 miles.</p>

<p>“Canyon Diablo has neither hotel nor
livery stable. Mr. Volz, the Indian trader
at this point, will, with advance notice,
furnish the necessities. Should there be
ladies in the party, and should it be possible
to secure Mr. Volz’s personal services for
the journey, this route offers certain advantages
not to be found by either of the
other two, and the cost is about the same.</p>

<p>“Whether our journey be made in winter
or summer, spring or autumn, we are sure
to intrude upon (for they are not to be
considered in any sense as ‘shows’) one or
more of the great ceremonials, usually an
invocation for rain, a propitiation of the<a id='p178'></a>
gods of the winds for bountiful harvests,
or a general thanksgiving for protection,
with the brilliant public pageant at the
close. But smile not at the curious sand
altars, with the ‘tiponi’ or palladium of the
fraternity, the childlike ‘bahos’ and ‘nakwakwosi,’
or prayer-sticks and offerings,
nor let the ears or eyes be offended by the
chanting of the songs to the gods of sun, of
winds and of rain, or the ceremonial dances
of the priests, for they are serious affairs
to the native participants.”<sup><a id='fn53r' href='#fn53'>3</a></sup></p>

<p>“It is in these strange, cliff-perched little
cities that one of the most astounding
barbaric dances in the world is held.
Africa has no savages whose mystic performances
are more wonderful than the
Hopi snake dance.</p>

<p><a id='p179'></a>“The snake is an object of great respect
among all uncivilized peoples, and the
deadlier his power, the deeper the reverence
for him. The Hopi often protect in their
houses an esteemed and harmless serpent—about
five or six feet long—as a mouse trap;
and these quiet mousers keep down the
little pests much more effectively than a
cat, for they can follow shee-id-deh to the
ultimate comer of his hole.”</p>

<p>Up to a generation ago every pueblo
protected at least one rattlesnake, but now
the Hopi Indian alone continues the custom.
Once a year the remarkable ceremony
of the snake dance is still performed,
and Mr. Lummis, from whom the above is
quoted, tells us that after the dance is
over he has seen a hillock of rattlesnakes a
foot high and four feet across.</p>

<p>“The dancers leap about this squirming
pile while sacred corn meal is sprinkled,
then thrust each an arm into the mass,
grasp a number of snakes, and go running
at top speed to the four points of the compass,
and thus the unharmed snakes are
released.”</p>

<div class='c sa1 sb2'>THE NAVAJO RESERVATION</div>

<p>To the north and east of the Hopi Reservation
is the Navajo Reservation, also
accessible by the Santa Fé Railroad.<a id='p180'></a>
These Indians, unlike their neighbours,
will not even touch a snake. Mr. Lummis
tells a most interesting story of his having
had a Navajo Indian make for him a silver
bracelet in the form of a snake. So extreme
are their prejudices that this silversmith
was almost beaten to death by his
fellows, and the bracelet, together with his
hut, were destroyed.</p>

<p>The Navajo reveres the bear as the Hopi
does the snake. They even go so far as
to make prayers and sacrifices to him.
They are the most wonderful of jugglers.
Dr. Washington Matthews, who was the
foremost student of Navajo customs, said
officially: “I have seen many fire scenes
on the stage, many acts of fire-eating and
fire-handling by civilized jugglers, but
nothing comparable to this.”</p>

<p>The Navajo blanket is known all over
this country; these Indians and the Hopi
are especially famous for their weaving.
But it is not to-day what it used to be; the
blanket to-day is made to sell, not to wear.</p>

<p>The Navajo Reservation is now a national<a id='p181'></a>
monument, and protects three extensive
prehistoric pueblos, or cliff dwellings,
in a good state of preservation.</p>

<!-- :special 2 0 1 -->
<div class='c sa1 sb2'>RAINBOW BRIDGE<br/> <span class='sm'>(NATIONAL MONUMENT)</span></div>

<p>In the Navajo Indian Reservation may
be seen the Rainbow Bridge National
Monument. The bridge is 309 feet above
the water, and its span is 279 feet. Among
the natural bridges of the world this one
is said to be unique, having not only a
symmetrical arch below but presenting also
a curved surface above, thus having the
appearance of a rainbow. An unusual trip
may be made from here to the Natural
Bridge National Monument, a distance
of 160 miles.</p>

<!-- :special 2 0 1 -->
<div class='c sa1 sb2'>PUEBLO OF COCHITI</div>

<p>“The most extensive and wonderful
cave communities in the world are in the
great Cochiti upland, some 50 miles northwest
of Santa Fé, New Mexico. The
journey is a very laborious one, but by no<a id='p182'></a>
means dangerous; and if you can get a good
guide, you are apt to remember it as the
most interesting expedition of your life.</p>

<p>“In the superbly picturesque canyon
of the Rito de los Frigoles is the largest of
all the villages of caves, deserted for more
than 400 years. Outside its unnumbered
cave rooms were more rooms yet, of masonry
of ‘bricks’ cut from the same cliff.</p>

<p>“A few miles farther up the Rio Grande,
not down in a canyon, but on the top of
a great plateau, nearly 2,000 feet above the
river, are two huge castle-like buttes of
chalky tufa, each some 200 feet high.
They stand one on each side of the Santa
Clara Canyon, and are known to the Indians,
respectively, as the Puye and the
Shu-fin-ne. They are the most easily
accessible of the large cave villages of
North America, not being more than 10
miles from the little railroad town of
Espanola, on the Rio Grande, some 30
miles by rail from Santa Fé.</p>

<p>“In this same wild region are the only
great stone idols (or, to speak more properly,<a id='p183'></a>
fetiches) in the United States—the
mountain lions of Cochiti. They are life
size and carved from the solid bedrock on
the top of two huge mesas. To this day
the Indians of Cochiti, before a hunt, go to
one of these almost inaccessible spots,
anoint the great stone head, and dance by
night, a wild dance, which no white man
has seen or ever will see.”<sup><a id='fn54r' href='#fn54'>4</a></sup></p>

<!-- :special 2 0 1 -->
<div class='c sa1 sb2'>THE PUEBLOS OF ACOMA AND LAGUNA</div>

<p>Acoma is 13 miles south of the Santa Fé
Railway in the western part of New Mexico.
It is reached from Laguna, which is in
itself another most interesting place; it is
the most recent of all the pueblos, having
been founded in 1699.</p>

<p>“Of all the 19 pueblos of New Mexico,
Acoma is by far the most wonderful. Indeed,
it is probably the most remarkable
city in the whole world. Perched upon the
level summit of a great ‘box’ of rock whose
perpendicular sides are nearly 400 feet high,
and reached by some of the dizziest paths<a id='p184'></a>
ever trodden by human feet, the prehistoric
town looks far across the wilderness. Its
quaint terraced houses of gray adobe, its
huge church—hardly less wonderful than
the pyramids of Egypt as a monument of
patient toil—its great reservoir in the solid
rock, its superb scenery, its romantic history
and the strange customs of its 600
people, all are rife with interest to the few
Americans who visit the isolated city.
Neither history nor tradition tells us when
Acoma was founded. The pueblo was
once situated on the top of the Mesa
Encantada (Enchanted Tableland), which
rises 700 feet, near the mesa now occupied.</p>

<p>“The present Acoma was an old town
when the first European—Coronado, the
famous Spanish explorer—saw it in 1540.
With that its authentic history begins—a
strange, weird history, in scattered fragments....</p>

<p>“Acoma is a labyrinth of wonders of
which no person alive knows all; the longest
visit never wears out its glamour. One
feels as among scenes and beings more than<a id='p185'></a>
human, all of whose rocks are genii and
whose people swart conjurors. It is spendthrift
of beauty.... It is the noblest
specimen of fantastic beauty on the continent.”</p>

<p>Laguna lies some 20 miles northeast of
Acoma. Mr. Lummis, from whom the
above is quoted, tells a most interesting
story of a law-suit carried on between these
two cities over the picture of a saint. The
story is told in “Some Strange Corners of
Our Country.” Not only does the writer
know these strange corners, but he has a
wonderful way of making his readers see
them.</p>

<!-- :special 2 0 1 -->
<div class='c sa1 sb2'>THE APACHE</div>

<p>The Apache reservations are in Arizona
and New Mexico. There is one, about
100 miles from El Paso, on the border of
Texas and New Mexico, but perhaps the
most accessible for tourists is the San Carlos
Agency of the White Mountain Reservation,
reached by stage from Holbrook, a
distance of about 96 miles.<a id='p186'></a></p>

<p>There are no Apache ruins, for this tribe
lived in tepees made of twigs, and not in
pueblos or permanent houses.</p>

<p>Basketmaking is the principal industry
among the women.</p>

<!-- :special 2 0 1 -->
<div class='c sa1 sb2'>CAPULIN MOUNTAIN<br/> <span class='sm'>(NATIONAL MONUMENT)</span></div>

<p>“This mountain in northeastern New
Mexico is a volcanic cinder cone of recent
origin, six miles southwest of Folsom. It
is the finest specimen of a group of
craters. Capulin has an altitude of 8,000
feet and rises 1,500 feet above the surrounding
plain. It is almost a perfect
cone. It is easily reached by either rail or
automobile.”</p>

<!-- :special 2 0 1 -->
<div class='c sa1 sb2'>BANDELIER NATIONAL MONUMENT</div>

<p>Eighteen miles west of Santa Fé, N. M.,
in a beautiful valley with high surrounding
walls some six miles long, and about one
half mile wide, with an entrance narrow
enough to admit but two persons abreast,<a id='p187'></a>
may be seen the home of a people who lived
in caves. This is a region full of interest;
there is here a large area which has been
suggested for a national park, to be called:
“The Cliff Cities National Park”; it is
reached by automobile from Santa Fé.</p>

<!-- :special 2 0 1 -->
<div class='c sa1 sb2'>ZUNI</div>

<p>Zuni is also reached by the Santa Fé
R. R. from Gallup. This is said to be the
largest of all the pueblos. At Zuni, Mr.
Frank Hamilton Cushing passed many
years of his life, as a member of the tribe.
This famous ethnologist probably learned
more of the real Indian, because more
closely associated with him, than any other
white man has done; he is the authority on
this particular tribe.</p>

<p>Conveyances can be had at Gallup for
the trip to Zuni, which is generally made
in a day. The pueblo lies in a level plain
on the southern bank of the Zuni River;
it may be seen at quite a distance, owing
to the irregularity in the height of the
houses, some of which are five stories, and<a id='p188'></a>
the irregular lay of the ground upon which
they are built.</p>

<p>To the traveller who has been to Acoma,
Zuni may be disappointing, or rather the
approach to Zuni, Acoma being built upon
a great rock mesa; but why compare such
different spots? Each has its own charm.
The ladders which are seen upon all sides at
Zuni add greatly to its picturesque appearance;
they have been well described as:
“A wilderness of masts.”</p>

<p>Pottery is the great industry of the
Zuni, in which art they excel; not only
are the jars, bowls, etc., beautifully
shaped, but the decorative designs, mostly
semi-geometric, and the combining of
the reds, browns, and black is wonderfully
artistic.</p>

<p>A great many religious rites exist in
Zuni, some such celebration taking place
every month, many in the open air, so
that it is possible that the tourist may
chance upon one of these at almost any
time. There is a famous Zuni dance held
in November each year, which may be<a id='p189'></a>
witnessed by all. There are many shrines
in this vicinity where visitors are allowed,
the most important of which is the one
on Thunder Mountain, quite a climb, but
worthy the effort; here the Zuni still make
their offerings of prayer-sticks, etc., to the
gods to whom this shrine is dedicated.</p>

<p>From Zuni the trip into the Painted Desert
may be made.</p>

<!-- :special 2 0 1 -->
<div class='c sa1 sb2'>EL MORRO<br/> <span class='sm'>(NATIONAL MONUMENT)</span></div>

<p>In western central New Mexico there
is an enormous sandstone rock, rising some
200 feet out of a plain, which, having a
small spring of water at its base, seems to
have made it a valuable camping place for
the Spanish explorers.</p>

<p>This rock contains some 21 Spanish inscriptions,
the earliest of which is dated
February 18, 1526; the most interesting is
probably that of Juan de Onate, the founder
of the city of Santa Fé in 1606.</p>

<!-- :special 2 0 1 -->
<div class='c sa1 sb2'>THE GRAN QUIVIRA<br/> <span class='sm'>(NATIONAL MONUMENT)</span></div>

<p><a id='p190'></a>“Eighty miles southwest of Albuquerque,
in the hollow of towering desert ranges, lies
the arid country which Indian tradition
calls the Accursed Lakes. Here at the
points of a large triangle sprawl the ruins
of three once flourishing pueblo cities,
Abo, Cuaray, and Tabirá. When the
Spaniards came these cities were at the
flood-tide of prosperity.”<sup><a id='fn55r' href='#fn55'>5</a></sup> At Tabirá was
built one of the important early Spanish
missions. The towns were discovered in
1581. The reservation preserves this interesting
mission ruin in Central New
Mexico.</p>

<!-- :special 2 0 1 -->
<div class='c sa1 sb2'>PHOENIX AND THE ROOSEVELT DAM</div>

<p><a id='p191'></a>Phoenix, the capital of Arizona, is the
starting point for several places of interest,
the chief, perhaps, being the Roosevelt
Dam.</p>

<p>This very picturesque and splendid dam
is built in a narrow canyon about 80 miles
from Phoenix; it holds in a fine natural
basin a great wealth of water. The lake
fills a valley 28 miles long, and in the hillsides
surrounding the water there are remains
of cliff and cave dwellings; here ancient
and modern masonry meet. These
dwellings are known as the “Tonto National
Monument.”</p>

<!-- :special 2 0 1 -->
<div class='c sa1 sb2'>THE APACHE TRAIL</div>

<p>For the traveller the most interesting
feature in this region is the Apache Trail.
An auto-stage leaves Phoenix daily for what
is known as the Globe-Miami district, 120
miles away. The trail leads through the
Salt River Valley, the Apache Gap (said to
be the scene of a battle between the 7th
Cavalry and the Apaches in 1886), to No
Man’s Land, and Summit, altitude 3,470
feet. On the descent are unusual panoramic
views of castellated cliffs and deep mountain
gorges, with the usual magic desert colouring.</p>

<p>The trail leads past the Roosevelt Dam<a id='p192'></a>
and lake with fine views all the way to
Globe, the home of the Old Dominion
Copper Co., and Miami, of the Inspiration
Copper Co., both mining towns.</p>

<!-- :special 2 0 1 -->
<div class='c sa1 sb2'>TUCSON</div>

<p>Tucson is a close rival of Phoenix. This
old town still has some of the charm of
ancient Mexico. A few miles from Tucson
there is one of the finest and best preserved
old missions of the Southwest, San Xavier.
The outside has been considerably restored
and, unfortunately, whitewashed, all but
the central portion, which happily is in
the original brownish colour. The interior
decorations, very ornate, are the originals.
The crudely carved wooden lions at the sides
of the altar rails date undoubtedly from
the founding, supposed to have been 1692.</p>

<!-- :special 2 0 1 -->
<div class='c sa1 sb2'>THE PAPAGO SAGUARO<br/> <span class='sm'>(NATIONAL MONUMENT)</span></div>

<p>About nine miles east of Phoenix and 12
miles from the Apache Trail, a small area
has been made a national monument on account<a id='p193'></a>
of its splendid examples of characteristic
desert flora. Here are to be seen striking
specimens of the giant cactus, Saguaro,
which attains a height of 30 to 35 feet and
is of a beautiful cylindrical form. Not only
this, but many other interesting species of
cacti and yucca grow here.</p>

<!-- :special 2 0 1 -->
<div class='c sa1 sb2'>WALNUT CANYON<br/> <span class='sm'>(NATIONAL MONUMENT)</span></div>

<p>Thirty cliff dwellings cling to the sides of
the picturesque Walnut Canyon, eight miles
from Flagstaff, Arizona. They are excellently
preserved. The largest contains
eight rooms. This canyon possesses unusual
beauty because of the thickets of
locust which fringe the trail down from the
ruins. Some of the ruins are only accessible
by ladder. Because of its nearness to
Flagstaff this group of dwellings is easily
visited.</p>

<!-- :special 2 0 1 -->
<div class='c sa1 sb2'>MONTEZUMA CASTLE<br/> <span class='sm'>(NATIONAL MONUMENT)</span></div>

<p>“Montezuma Castle, a remarkable relic of
a prehistoric race, is the principal feature of<a id='p194'></a>
a well-preserved group of cliff dwellings in
the northeastern part of Yavapai County,
Arizona. Its position and size give it the
appearance of an ancient castle. The
structure is about 50 feet high by 60 feet
wide, built in the form of a crescent. It is
five stories high, with walls of masonry
and adobe, plastered inside with mud.”</p>

<!-- :special 2 0 1 -->
<div class='c sa1 sb2'>THE CASA GRANDE<br/> <span class='sm'>(NATIONAL MONUMENT)</span></div>

<p>This is one of the most remarkable prehistoric
ruins in the country. It is about
70 miles from Tucson, perhaps nearer the
border town of Sonora. “A building of
large size, evidently this was an important
centre of population. The builders were
probably Pima Indians. Whatever its
origin, the community was already in ruins
when the Spaniards found it.”</p>

<p>The first report we have of it is in 1539.
The whole is now roofed over for protection.</p>

<!-- :special 2 0 1 -->
<div class='c sa1 sb2'>AN APPEAL TO TOURISTS</div>

<p>It is earnestly requested of all travellers,
old and young alike, that they shall do<a id='p195'></a>
their part toward preserving unimpaired
the beauty of the spots that they visit, and
that instead of disfiguring the landscape
by scattering the débris of their lunch-baskets,
together with torn papers and
broken boxes, all along their route, they
shall conscientiously avail themselves of
the trash-cans everywhere liberally provided
for their use.</p>

<p>The names of a few reference books are
herewith appended in order that the traveller
who is especially interested in any
particular line may be enabled to find some
extra information along that line if he so
wish.</p>

<p>Doubtless there are countless other
books to be had on any of these subjects,
but I have tried to name one which will be
of service in looking up birds, trees, flowers,
pottery, blankets, glaciers, Indian basketry,
cliff dwellings, etc., etc.</p>

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
